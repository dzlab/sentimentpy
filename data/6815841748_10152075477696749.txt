message:	"My health insurance is over $600 a month. It started out around $300 and over the years it's been upped and upped and upped. I'm waiting for a letter from the new insurance company - but with Obama's plan I would be on a much better health plan and be saving nearly TWO HUNDRED a month. (Before Obamacare I tried to switch to another health insurance company and I was denied because of my health problems.) I can't live without the medications I take. I have a steady job. I pay my taxes. For those who think Obamacare is useless/etc - maybe you should stop thinking of yourselves and try to think of the other people out there who need help. There are people like me who work their butts off but can't afford $150+ every time they go to the pharmacy (and that's WITH insurance.) Stop thinking about yourselves and try - for a moment, if you can - to think about the other human beings you share this country with. Stop being so freaking selfish for a change."

Congress is going to allow all the illegals to collect on theirs! If you are young, just have plenty of babies. If you don't want to denounce your citizenship.,just start using a SSN that is NOT your own. You don't need one to get employment. Once you are hired just make one up! You can sue your employer if they fire you for this. You can develop a credit report with a fake SSN. Then go work some where else using a different SSN. Make sure you do a change of address and new phone number. Goodness don't pay back those high interest credit cards. I am writing a book on how to beat the system!  You can even avoid child support garnishment! When 2 illegal Hispanics used their names but my husband's SSN they taught me how to screw everyone and guess what! The federal government doesn't care! Google Robert Guenterberg. By the way, when you retire just walk into your local SSA office and show your real SSN card. The SSA will take everything out of their Social Security Suspense Earning file and you can collect your retirement."

I am being sent to a clinic and pay their price for doctors plus meds. Just for one that I needed on Monday, I spent 40 dls. And it was a generic. I have written to you, like now, many times. No one pays attention to the "gray" people like me. The ones that don\'t fit: 63 year olds, not making enough and not getting Medicare or Medicaid...I have an application number. I hope I don\'t get fined, on top of all this!'

I went through the process and my husband and I now have healthcare that we can afford and that comes with a primary care doctor and routine treatment for my diabetes.

What is the point of having some of the best Health Care in the world if it\'s not made available to the sick?'

message:	'To whoever has a chance to read my messages\n\nThis is my perspective point of view only. It is not intend to be on any side except for my beloved King of Thailand.\n\nI am writing to you all about the problems that have been long term issues in Thailand, the land of smile, sincereness, and kindness country. The problem where people are fighting for their right to make Thailand change to be a better country for our children who will grow up to be adults who are responsible for our country.\n\nI believe in Thailand have occurs to be separate in four groups. One is group of people who support a better future politic. People who are stepping out to fight for all of us. To fight, hope, pray and believe for a better quality, fairness, and sincereness new pry minister. People who love our King so much and would like to fight for our future country for a better place to live for our children.\nSecond group is the group of people who are standing up for the ex-pry minister names Taksin Chinnawat. We believe those group of people who care to be on his side are manageable, controllable by the power of his billionaire money . Some who fight for him have a believe in term of think that if i support him, he will be the one to help me make more money because Taksin is a business man. He knows how to be a good business, but he failed to be a great pry minister at that time. We elected him to be a pry minister of Thailand in term of hoping he will be the one. The one who did not corrupt our money since he had been so rich already.The one who we believe to work hard to improve Thailand for a more civilized country. He was using our trust to destroy our country for his own good sake. He used his power to create a system called Taksin system where everywhere he went, everything he did were just to make him richer and richer. Some of people who joined his group had been tighten by money and business only. Some people who support him are people from countryside or people who accept his money to come fight for his power.\nThe third group is the group of people who do not care anything about our country. Not only that they enjoy making the situation get worse. They has not been standing up on any side , but for themselves.\nThe last group is the group who does not standing up on any side and tend to be does not care about anything either they have busy lives making more money or busy lives taking care their own business. What they do only upset about all the fights that occur in Thailand.\nAbout the protests that have been occurring in Thailand. For me, I am standing up for my King and Queen. I am standing up for a better future country for our children who will become quality adult in the future. I am standing up to destroy Taksin Chinnawat system who had have his sister Yinglak, pry minister of Thailand to be his own doll who he had been controlling behind the scene. I hope and pray for all of you, Thai Citizen who spend your valuable time to fight for me and for all of us. I am standing up for a true democracy in Thailand, not Communist.\nI am hoping and praying for one day, we will have a better Pry Minister who really care about Thai citizen more than himself. The Pry Minister who is a hard working, sincere, kind and care enough for all of us. The Pry Minister who is not care to make more money by his power for his own good sake. The chosen one who cares about our poor people.\nThere are ton of people who live on the street with no foods, clothes, nothing.\nPry Minister who sincerely love our Thai people just like how our king love his citizen.\nOur King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been working so hard all his life for his citizen. He work for no money. He cares for his citizen unconditionally.\nHe works so hard to improve our country for a more civilized place for all of his citizen. He had done many projects to help so many farmers in Thailand have a better lives. He has taught them many ways to improve a better quality and efficiency farms and products, so they can have a better lives. What he has done to all of us are not something that I can write here and finish it in one day. There are no words to describe enough how wonderful king he is. All I know is I love and respect my King very much from the bottom of my heart. I will do every way to make him happy. I will support whoever stand up on our king side. I will do every way I can to fight to whoever try to make my King unhappy.\n\nThis is a message from me Jutinut Suwanpathumlerd to Yinklak Chinawat and his brother Taksin Chinnawat.\n\nGO TO HELL\n\nYou are not belong to Thailand. You do not deserve to stand on the land where our King has work so hard for his citizen.\n\nOur country is not a country for your business, good sake and selfish.\n\nAgain just one writing will not be enough to describe how bad they are.\n\nYinkluck, go to hell. You do not deserve to have a power in Thailand if you can not use your power in a way for others, not for herself and her family. You guys are rich enough!!!\n\nGet out and go to hell. You and your stupid sister are not Thai citizen. You are not belong to Thailand.\n\nI apologize if my writing here would hurt anyone feeling.\nI apologize for my poor english skills if i made any mistake here.\n\nI do not apologize to Taksin, Yinklak and their supports group.'

My individual plan was no longer accepted & I was told I had to go find a group plan. I will be taking a loss of $4,500 as I was on a MRP from my employer. The group plan they are forcing me into is $1782 per quarter, up from $695 I WAS paying. This all happened because they, "Had to pass the bill, so that they could find out what is in it".

message:	"The insurance companies are not going to go broke.  They would be insane to deny people treatment. They did not discontinue policies because they couldn't afford to comply with the ACA. Here's why :The insurance companies are allowed to make no more than 20% profit now because of the law. It does not matter how much prices go up or down, they will not make more or be forced to take less.  If the they choose to insure more people , they will make 20% on more policies.  They make 20% on the crappy policies, and they make 20% on the Cadillac policies.  So it wasn't exactly the cost increase for them to provide better insurance that caused them to drop people. It is more about hoping people will get rid of their lowball insurance plans and go for a bigger one.  Now if people get more expensive insurance, they will get 20% of a larger amount.  If a person requires $100 for treatment, they will make $20.  If the person requires $10,000 treatment, they will make $2,000. The extra actual costs of the insurance will be passed along to the consumer.  No downside for the insurance companies at this point.  The lobbied FOR the ACA The upside to this is that it appears to be working.  Medical spending has ALWAYS increased, but this year it increased the least that it has in 50 years!"

message:	'The economic inequality in this country is just the tip of the iceberg considering that fact that those who are placed in high powered positions like cooperate banks, IMF want to divide wealth while destabilizing communities that creates a profit of prosperity for families. they destroy industrial profits by allowing those who control government to interfere with applicable opportunity, knowing that they households can make a profit managing their own economy. I don\'t dislike capitalism but I really wish that it didn\'t divide and conquer like it does, meaning that corporations who believe in it should be less selfish and be more into dynamism.\n2 minutes ago\n"Poverty is the ill definition of a hell condition, lack of prosperity and fortune and the money we spend on war should go to those who are living in it. if only money didn\'t overrule our democracy pro-capitalistically like international federal reserve banking systems, we\'d all be rich. forget corporations overhauling people who work minimum wage, why don\'t you don\'t deliver the solution, instead of using government interference to block applicability from reaching it\'s maximum. defense spending is useless, just like pumping billions into the economy considering the fact, that quantitative easing should never be used again because it undermines the debt, consumer price index with the value of economic recuperation and what the currency creates".'

A 5 page bill could have taken care of the rest, but Obamacare was never about healthcare.  It's always been a data mining ponzi scheme, designed to redistribute the wealth. I heard on the radio today liberals crowing about Canadian healthcare. 2 problems with comparing us to Canada. 1-the sick in Canada aren't crowing about their healthcare.  Wait times to see specialists is 2 to 3 times longer than in the US. 2- Although Canada is a large country land wise, its population is less than California. I'm guessing it's a little easier to manage the healthcare needs on a state level than this one size fits few, national monstrosity."

message:	u'Dreamin, Embassy attacks?  Bush and Clinton both suffered it BUT...the answer is actually pretty simple: yeah, there were x-number of embassy attacks under Bush and they did not require investigations. For that matter there were all of these attacks on embassies and American interests under President Clinton, and they didn\u2019t require investigations, either.  Why not? Well, because under Bush the embassy attacks were taking place mostly in Iraq, and during a time of acknowledged war \u2014 right in the thick of it, in fact \u2014 and no one tried to argue that they were anything but planned and executed attacks.   And during the Clinton years, the attacks \u2014 which took place an average of every 18 months \u2014 were recognized as planned, organized attacks and no one tried to argue that they were anything different, either.  And while our embassies were attacked under these presidents, and others, none of our Ambassadors were murdered (along with Navy Seals) while multiple stand-down orders were given against mounting a rescue.  Neither the Bush nor Clinton administrations sought to mischaracterize the attacks on their embassies. Neither of them disseminated weirdly vague stories that was \u201creally\u201d took place was a spontaneous protest over an unseen, stupid video. And it was not the Bush (or Clinton) administration that \u2014 even after acknowledging a terror attack had occurred \u2014 repeated those lies to grieving parents or (weeks later) in a speech to the UN where the \u201cvideo\u201d was blamed six times.   See there is a difference, Bush, Clinton even Reagan had these issues BUT...Benghazi...well read it for yourself.'

message:	u'After the Affordable Care Act, 2010 "ObamaCare" is fully implemented with the new state exchanges and fine-tuned; it will join the ranks of Social Security and Medicare as the three best anti-poverty programs ever enacted into law in the country. Health care account for 18% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. There are 48.6 million uninsured Americans according to the 2012 census, and 37% of all uninsured Americans have household incomes above $50,000. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spent more on health care per capita ($8,608), and more on health care as percentage of its GDP than any other nation in 2012. The Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries, and notes U.S. care costs the most. In a 2013 ranking of nations with the most efficient health care systems, the United States ranks 46th among the 48 countries included in the study. Recent evidence demonstrates that lack of health insurance causes some 45,000 to 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States. In 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses. A 2013 study found that about 25% of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 43% are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence. In some states, over a quarter of the population is uninsured, including 6 million in Texas. In addition to having the highest rate of people without health insurance in the nation, Texas also has the largest number of children without health insurance and the highest rate of poor adults without health insurance, according to 2012 American Community Survey estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2012. So; would you prefer people use the emergency room for their primary health care and the most expensive with the least wellness outcome; or do you want affordable health care for all that would bend the cost curve and force people to take some personal responsibility for their health care? Where is the Republican/Tea Party alternative health care plan that would keep Americans out of the emergency room? \nkeep in mind that \'taxpayers\' subsidize the uninsured by an average $1,100 in federal taxes every year. Hospitals absorb some of the costs which lead to high rates for patients, and higher premium costs for private insurance policies. Private health care insurance will continue to exist in the country, although policies were often substandard before the Affordable Care Act, 2010...and the most expensive in the world. One key in reaching the goal of universal coverage is making uninsured Americans aware that they need health care insurance. By this time next year; the Republican/Tea Party will be trying to take credit for the success of the program. All of those right wing talk show hosts and Congressional members who complain daily and tried to defund or repeal the Affordable Care Act, 2010 "ObamaCare" forty-eight (48) times have excellent health care insurance coverage (and some are subsidized by taxpayers) for themselves and their families. In 1936, when Franklin Roosevelt came up with Social Security, a Republican filibuster stopped FDR from funding the offices and personnel he needed to implement it. In addition to that, Alf Landon, the Republican candidate for president said, \u2018My first act of office will be to abolish Social Security.\u2019 "All the really great programs in American history was done without Republicans. Medicare in 1965 was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board."'

I believe that\'s what it\'s called when you pack up and go home, when a war fought under your own "civilized" terms is unwinnable."\n\u25fe"And if the liberal media and political community cannot accept that sometimes the wrong people get killed in war, then I can only suggest they first grow up and then serve a short stint up in the Hindu Kush. They probably would not survive."\n\u25fe"[Letting the goat herders go] was the stupidest, most southern-fried, lamebrained decision I ever made in my life. I must have been out of my mind. I had actually cast a vote which I knew could sign our death warrant. I\'d turned into a f@@cking liberal, a half-assed, no-logic nitwit, all heart, no brain, and the judgment of a jackrabbit."  So make sure you read the book...Hollywood does not tell the real story.   Gee...isn\'t his the same half azz logic LBJ\'s boys used in Viet Nam???   If you read the book you would know letting the goat herders go compromised the mission and Marcus\'s three buddies died because of it.  16 more died trying to rescue Marcus.  Bleeding heart liberals...'

Around 14,000 policies were cancelled every single month before the ACA, sometimes while the patient was in the hospital getting treatment. Now at least if you are cancelled you can still get insurance, even if you have a preexisting condition.    That kind of behavior by the insurance companies is exactly why we needed reform.'

message:	u'This story originally appeared on Huffington Post and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nWikiLeaks published a leaked draft of the environment chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Wednesday, and environmental groups are lining up to take a swing.The leaked documents come from a meeting of the trade deal\'s chief negotiators held in Salt Lake City, Utah, from Nov. 19 to 24, 2013. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) includes 12 countries-the United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei-and would govern a number of international environmental and trade issuesThe draft indicates the pact will include a number of promises on the environment, but will lack strong enforcement tools. "When compared against other TPP chapters, the Environment Chapter is noteworthy for its absence of mandated clauses or meaningful enforcement measures," wrote WikiLeaks in its release. The chapter is intended to deal with issues like overfishing, trade of wood products, wildlife crime, and illegal logging. But most of the measures in the chapter are voluntary, rather than binding, and do not include penalties or criminal sanctions for violations. Compliance is largely left to the respective countries.\n\nEnviros offered similar criticism. "The lack of fully-enforceable environmental safeguards means negotiators are allowing a unique opportunity to protect wildlife and support legal sustainable trade of renewable resources to slip through their fingers," said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund, in a statement.The leaked document from November is only a draft, but if the trade pact\'s final environmental chapter looks like it, it would make the Obama administration\'s environmental trade record "worse than George W. Bush\'s," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. "This draft chapter falls flat on every single one of our issues\u2013oceans, fish, wildlife, and forest protections\u2013and in fact, rolls back on the progress made in past free trade pacts."According to a report from the chairs of the TPP Environmental Working Group drafting the chapter, also released by WikiLeaks, there remains significant disagreement among the parties on many of the pact\'s provisions. The chairs wrote that Vietnam, Peru and Malaysia object to a provision calling for countries to "rationalize and phase out" fossil fuel subsidies "that encourage wasteful consumption." They also noted that the United States and Australia object to the climate change portion of the pact as it is written.Negotiation of the pact has been underway since 2010, but all discussions take place entirely outside of public view. The Obama administration has already received backlash for leaked portions of the pact that indicate it would grant greater rights to corporations to challenge national laws in private courts.\n\nEfforts to fast-track the trade deal met resistance from Democrats in Congress this week.\n\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to a request for comment on the documents.'

Found a plan with $1000 deductible and $1500 more out of pocket and low or no co pays for routine care & screening - for about $100 less than I've been paying.  Healthcare.gov allowed me to easily shop the marketplace and get the new policy - easily.  If companies have been raising their rates to ridiculous levels, blame your state insurance departments who are approving those rates.  BTW, I have twice gotten refunds of premiums because of the 80/20 rule - at least something to assure companies are spending dollars on healthcare."

If you want to have a civilized and intellectual argument, don't say something so utterly stupid and weak."

More than 1.8 million of them signed up in December alone, a huge spike that has gotten the law closer to its original goals than most would have thought possible after HealthCare.gov\'s disastrous rollout in October"\n\nRepublicans have had nearly 4 years at this point to come up with an alternative to Obamacare. If they were serious about reforming America\'s pathetic healthcare system, and there was such an obviously better alternative that they had (that they were willing to enact), then they would have crafted it and passed it in the House already, and they would have been pressuring the Senate and Obama to enact it.\n\nThe fact that they STILL have nothing betrays every single point they\'ve made against Obamacare, or about American health care in general since Obama took office.\n\nhttp://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/obamacare-december-enrollment-numbers'

The democrats spending went through the roof. And it was democratic congress. Senate. And president for two years. They controlled evwrything and spent like drunken sailors. Obama doubled deficit boq. A trillion bucks on a stimulus that didnt create jobs.\n\nEvery single recession in history was fixed by cutting taxes and spending.\nIncome inequality is the worst in history under obama.'

In a letter to Congress, the White House said that Walpin was fired because he was \u201cconfused, disoriented, unable to answer questions and exhibited other behavior that led the Board to question his capacity to serve.\u201d A bipartisan group of 145 current and former public officials, attorneys, and legal scholars signed a letter that was sent to the White House, which defended Walpin, said the criticisms of him were not true, and said that his firing was politically motivated.'

Jeden Tag schnappe die NSA den Unterlagen zufolge \xfcber f\xfcnf Millionen solcher Benachrichtigungen auf. Au\xdferdem wiesen 1,6 Millionen registrierte Roaming-Nachrichten auf Grenz\xfcbertritte hin.\nIn einer internen Pr\xe4sentation beschreibt die NSA die SMS-Nachrichten als wahre \u201eGoldgrube\u201c.\nAuch der britische Dienst GCHQ soll Zugriff auf die Daten gehabt haben, um sie mit Informationen \xfcber britische B\xfcrger abgleichen zu k\xf6nnen.\nDie Enth\xfcllungs-Dokumente stammen laut \u201eGuardian\u201c aus dem Fundus des Informanten Edward Snowden und wurden 2012 von einer Seite mit Anleitungen zum \u201eDishfire\u201d-System f\xfcr GCHQ-Mitarbeiter heruntergeladen.

Am Donnerstag unterrichtete Obama bereits den britischen Premier David Cameron \xfcber seine geplante Reform.\nUS-Medien berichteten allerdings bereits im Vorfeld der Rede, Obama plane, wichtige Entscheidungen dem Kongress zu \xfcberlassen. Einerseits wolle er die Forderungen der Geheimdienste f\xfcr einen effektiven Anti-Terror-Kampf ber\xfccksichtigen. Andererseits wolle er die weltweite Emp\xf6rung d\xe4mpfen.'

I'm waiting for a letter from the new insurance company - but with Obama's plan I would be on a much better health plan and be saving nearly TWO HUNDRED a month. (Before Obamacare I tried to switch to another health insurance company and I was denied because of my health problems.) I can't live without the medications I take. I have a steady job. I pay my taxes. For those who think Obamacare is useless/etc - maybe you should stop thinking of yourselves and try to think of the other people out there who need help. There are people like me who work their butts off but can't afford $150+ every time they go to the pharmacy (and that's WITH insurance.) Stop thinking about yourselves and try - for a moment, if you can - to think about the other human beings you share this country with. Stop being so freaking selfish for a change."

Wink wink!\n\n-------------\n\nWhere the hell did this come from with me saying what my experience was with the marketplace?  Jesus you people need to lighten up and stop living behind the animosity of the internet.  I was BORN there, been living in Florida since 89.  No, we/I dont make a lot, but thats ok since I spend my days/nights/weekends helping families and individuals with Autism.  You are a very sad/bitter individual.

Congress is going to allow all the illegals to collect on theirs! If you are young, just have plenty of babies. If you don't want to denounce your citizenship.,just start using a SSN that is NOT your own. You don't need one to get employment. Once you are hired just make one up! You can sue your employer if they fire you for this. You can develop a credit report with a fake SSN. Then go work some where else using a different SSN. Make sure you do a change of address and new phone number. Goodness don't pay back those high interest credit cards. I am writing a book on how to beat the system!  You can even avoid child support garnishment! When 2 illegal Hispanics used their names but my husband's SSN they taught me how to screw everyone and guess what! The federal government doesn't care! Google Robert Guenterberg. By the way, when you retire just walk into your local SSA office and show your real SSN card. The SSA will take everything out of their Social Security Suspense Earning file and you can collect your retirement."

The lady at the exchange told me that the states are overwhelmed with the amount of people that it is putting on medicaid. So it is not cheaper.

message:	'To whoever has a chance to read my messages\n\nThis is my perspective point of view only. It is not intend to be on any side except for my beloved King of Thailand.\n\nI am writing to you all about the problems that have been long term issues in Thailand, the land of smile, sincereness, and kindness country. The problem where people are fighting for their right to make Thailand change to be a better country for our children who will grow up to be adults who are responsible for our country.\n\nI believe in Thailand have occurs to be separate in four groups. One is group of people who support a better future politic. People who are stepping out to fight for all of us. To fight, hope, pray and believe for a better quality, fairness, and sincereness new pry minister. People who love our King so much and would like to fight for our future country for a better place to live for our children.\nSecond group is the group of people who are standing up for the ex-pry minister names Taksin Chinnawat. We believe those group of people who care to be on his side are manageable, controllable by the power of his billionaire money . Some who fight for him have a believe in term of think that if i support him, he will be the one to help me make more money because Taksin is a business man. He knows how to be a good business, but he failed to be a great pry minister at that time. We elected him to be a pry minister of Thailand in term of hoping he will be the one. The one who did not corrupt our money since he had been so rich already.The one who we believe to work hard to improve Thailand for a more civilized country. He was using our trust to destroy our country for his own good sake. He used his power to create a system called Taksin system where everywhere he went, everything he did were just to make him richer and richer. Some of people who joined his group had been tighten by money and business only. Some people who support him are people from countryside or people who accept his money to come fight for his power.\nThe third group is the group of people who do not care anything about our country. Not only that they enjoy making the situation get worse. They has not been standing up on any side , but for themselves.\nThe last group is the group who does not standing up on any side and tend to be does not care about anything either they have busy lives making more money or busy lives taking care their own business. What they do only upset about all the fights that occur in Thailand.\nAbout the protests that have been occurring in Thailand. For me, I am standing up for my King and Queen. I am standing up for a better future country for our children who will become quality adult in the future. I am standing up to destroy Taksin Chinnawat system who had have his sister Yinglak, pry minister of Thailand to be his own doll who he had been controlling behind the scene. I hope and pray for all of you, Thai Citizen who spend your valuable time to fight for me and for all of us. I am standing up for a true democracy in Thailand, not Communist.\nI am hoping and praying for one day, we will have a better Pry Minister who really care about Thai citizen more than himself. The Pry Minister who is a hard working, sincere, kind and care enough for all of us. The Pry Minister who is not care to make more money by his power for his own good sake. The chosen one who cares about our poor people.\nThere are ton of people who live on the street with no foods, clothes, nothing.\nPry Minister who sincerely love our Thai people just like how our king love his citizen.\nOur King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been working so hard all his life for his citizen. He work for no money. He cares for his citizen unconditionally.\nHe works so hard to improve our country for a more civilized place for all of his citizen. He had done many projects to help so many farmers in Thailand have a better lives. He has taught them many ways to improve a better quality and efficiency farms and products, so they can have a better lives. What he has done to all of us are not something that I can write here and finish it in one day. There are no words to describe enough how wonderful king he is. All I know is I love and respect my King very much from the bottom of my heart. I will do every way to make him happy. I will support whoever stand up on our king side. I will do every way I can to fight to whoever try to make my King unhappy.\n\nThis is a message from me Jutinut Suwanpathumlerd to Yinklak Chinawat and his brother Taksin Chinnawat.\n\nGO TO HELL\n\nYou are not belong to Thailand. You do not deserve to stand on the land where our King has work so hard for his citizen.\n\nOur country is not a country for your business, good sake and selfish.\n\nAgain just one writing will not be enough to describe how bad they are.\n\nYinkluck, go to hell. You do not deserve to have a power in Thailand if you can not use your power in a way for others, not for herself and her family. You guys are rich enough!!!\n\nGet out and go to hell. You and your stupid sister are not Thai citizen. You are not belong to Thailand.\n\nI apologize if my writing here would hurt anyone feeling.\nI apologize for my poor english skills if i made any mistake here.\n\nI do not apologize to Taksin, Yinklak and their supports group.'

message:	"The insurance companies are not going to go broke.  They would be insane to deny people treatment. They did not discontinue policies because they couldn't afford to comply with the ACA. Here's why :The insurance companies are allowed to make no more than 20% profit now because of the law. It does not matter how much prices go up or down, they will not make more or be forced to take less.  If the they choose to insure more people , they will make 20% on more policies.  They make 20% on the crappy policies, and they make 20% on the Cadillac policies.  So it wasn't exactly the cost increase for them to provide better insurance that caused them to drop people. It is more about hoping people will get rid of their lowball insurance plans and go for a bigger one.  Now if people get more expensive insurance, they will get 20% of a larger amount.  If a person requires $100 for treatment, they will make $20.  If the person requires $10,000 treatment, they will make $2,000. The extra actual costs of the insurance will be passed along to the consumer.  No downside for the insurance companies at this point.  The lobbied FOR the ACA The upside to this is that it appears to be working.  Medical spending has ALWAYS increased, but this year it increased the least that it has in 50 years!"

message:	'The economic inequality in this country is just the tip of the iceberg considering that fact that those who are placed in high powered positions like cooperate banks, IMF want to divide wealth while destabilizing communities that creates a profit of prosperity for families. they destroy industrial profits by allowing those who control government to interfere with applicable opportunity, knowing that they households can make a profit managing their own economy. I don\'t dislike capitalism but I really wish that it didn\'t divide and conquer like it does, meaning that corporations who believe in it should be less selfish and be more into dynamism.\n2 minutes ago\n"Poverty is the ill definition of a hell condition, lack of prosperity and fortune and the money we spend on war should go to those who are living in it. if only money didn\'t overrule our democracy pro-capitalistically like international federal reserve banking systems, we\'d all be rich. forget corporations overhauling people who work minimum wage, why don\'t you don\'t deliver the solution, instead of using government interference to block applicability from reaching it\'s maximum. defense spending is useless, just like pumping billions into the economy considering the fact, that quantitative easing should never be used again because it undermines the debt, consumer price index with the value of economic recuperation and what the currency creates".'

A 5 page bill could have taken care of the rest, but Obamacare was never about healthcare.  It's always been a data mining ponzi scheme, designed to redistribute the wealth. I heard on the radio today liberals crowing about Canadian healthcare. 2 problems with comparing us to Canada. 1-the sick in Canada aren't crowing about their healthcare.  Wait times to see specialists is 2 to 3 times longer than in the US. 2- Although Canada is a large country land wise, its population is less than California. I'm guessing it's a little easier to manage the healthcare needs on a state level than this one size fits few, national monstrosity."

message:	u'Dreamin, Embassy attacks?  Bush and Clinton both suffered it BUT...the answer is actually pretty simple: yeah, there were x-number of embassy attacks under Bush and they did not require investigations. For that matter there were all of these attacks on embassies and American interests under President Clinton, and they didn\u2019t require investigations, either.  Why not? Well, because under Bush the embassy attacks were taking place mostly in Iraq, and during a time of acknowledged war \u2014 right in the thick of it, in fact \u2014 and no one tried to argue that they were anything but planned and executed attacks.   And during the Clinton years, the attacks \u2014 which took place an average of every 18 months \u2014 were recognized as planned, organized attacks and no one tried to argue that they were anything different, either.  And while our embassies were attacked under these presidents, and others, none of our Ambassadors were murdered (along with Navy Seals) while multiple stand-down orders were given against mounting a rescue.  Neither the Bush nor Clinton administrations sought to mischaracterize the attacks on their embassies. Neither of them disseminated weirdly vague stories that was \u201creally\u201d took place was a spontaneous protest over an unseen, stupid video. And it was not the Bush (or Clinton) administration that \u2014 even after acknowledging a terror attack had occurred \u2014 repeated those lies to grieving parents or (weeks later) in a speech to the UN where the \u201cvideo\u201d was blamed six times.   See there is a difference, Bush, Clinton even Reagan had these issues BUT...Benghazi...well read it for yourself.'

message:	u'After the Affordable Care Act, 2010 "ObamaCare" is fully implemented with the new state exchanges and fine-tuned; it will join the ranks of Social Security and Medicare as the three best anti-poverty programs ever enacted into law in the country. Health care account for 18% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. There are 48.6 million uninsured Americans according to the 2012 census, and 37% of all uninsured Americans have household incomes above $50,000. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spent more on health care per capita ($8,608), and more on health care as percentage of its GDP than any other nation in 2012. The Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries, and notes U.S. care costs the most. In a 2013 ranking of nations with the most efficient health care systems, the United States ranks 46th among the 48 countries included in the study. Recent evidence demonstrates that lack of health insurance causes some 45,000 to 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States. In 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses. A 2013 study found that about 25% of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 43% are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence. In some states, over a quarter of the population is uninsured, including 6 million in Texas. In addition to having the highest rate of people without health insurance in the nation, Texas also has the largest number of children without health insurance and the highest rate of poor adults without health insurance, according to 2012 American Community Survey estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2012. So; would you prefer people use the emergency room for their primary health care and the most expensive with the least wellness outcome; or do you want affordable health care for all that would bend the cost curve and force people to take some personal responsibility for their health care? Where is the Republican/Tea Party alternative health care plan that would keep Americans out of the emergency room? \nkeep in mind that \'taxpayers\' subsidize the uninsured by an average $1,100 in federal taxes every year. Hospitals absorb some of the costs which lead to high rates for patients, and higher premium costs for private insurance policies. Private health care insurance will continue to exist in the country, although policies were often substandard before the Affordable Care Act, 2010...and the most expensive in the world. One key in reaching the goal of universal coverage is making uninsured Americans aware that they need health care insurance. By this time next year; the Republican/Tea Party will be trying to take credit for the success of the program. All of those right wing talk show hosts and Congressional members who complain daily and tried to defund or repeal the Affordable Care Act, 2010 "ObamaCare" forty-eight (48) times have excellent health care insurance coverage (and some are subsidized by taxpayers) for themselves and their families. In 1936, when Franklin Roosevelt came up with Social Security, a Republican filibuster stopped FDR from funding the offices and personnel he needed to implement it. In addition to that, Alf Landon, the Republican candidate for president said, \u2018My first act of office will be to abolish Social Security.\u2019 "All the really great programs in American history was done without Republicans. Medicare in 1965 was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board."'

message:	u'UMA TORTURA POL\xcdTICA!\n\n        O Maranh\xe3o foi figura do cen\xe1rio nacional. Foi quase que condenado pelo sistema carcer\xe1rio do Complexo Penitenci\xe1rio de Pedrinha. Tudo motivado pelas mortes que l\xe1 foram proporcionados pelos delinquentes que ali est\xe3o condenados a pena. Os maranhenses estavam quase que detidos pelas for\xe7as existente da pol\xedtica de oposi\xe7\xe3o ao governo do Estado. Tudo numa deprava\xe7\xe3o de aceitamento de aproveitamentos de consequ\xeancias geradas por falta de assist\xeancia aos pres\xeddios e aos fieis moradores daquelas existentes resid\xeancias dos pobres coitados que ali est\xe3o na sua complexidade de viver bem. Quem sabe at\xe9 melhor do que as vitimas que lhes foram feitas atrav\xe9s das a\xe7\xf5es criminosas que as comentaram contra as pessoas de bens.\n          Vieram pra c\xe1 o governo Federal, Direitos humanos e os cambaos pra que pudessem dar melhor assist\xeancia ao Complexo Penitenci\xe1rio de Pedrinhas ou mesmo ter as largadas pra constru\xe7\xe3o de novos pres\xeddios pra conforma aqueles coitados delinquentes. Ai vem por tr\xe1s dos acontecimentos os aproveitamentos pol\xedticos, aqueles que se colocam no obscuro e passam por um santo de pau oco. E ais passam por serem os apoiadores da melhora de tudo que \xe9 preciso, e ainda por cima de tudo vai levando pra outro lado da pol\xedtica pensando que os maranhenses s\xe3o incapazes de nota os erros dos precipitados oposicionistas que torcem por um Maranh\xe3o mais atrasado. Quem n\xe3o esta vendo o crescimento do Estado, quem n\xe3o esta vendo cidades sendo asfaltadas e sendo interligadas com as BRs que fazem parte do desenvolvimento rural e urbano daqueles munic\xedpios que viviam no isolamento da sua estrada asfaltada pra o escoamento de sua produ\xe7\xe3o.\n            O avan\xe7o esta a olho nu visto por todos, ent\xe3o porque esses ataques contundentes, que deixam a consci\xeancia maranhense descontentes com a oposi\xe7\xe3o com seu posicionamento pol\xedtico. Porque n\xe3o procurar de forma coerente trabalhar em vez de atrapalhar, e dentro do contexto pol\xedtico evidenciar seus projetos e com essa a\xe7\xe3o deixar com que o governo fa\xe7a o seu trabalho como esta a fazer. Constru\xe7\xe3o de Upas, de Hospitais, de col\xe9gios, de estradas e de melhoramento at\xe9 da Ponta da Madeira, pra aqueles que v\xe3o viaja de ferry boaty terem melhor conforto na espera de sua viajem no atravessa do mar, pra irem a Baixada Maranhense.\n              A tortura pol\xedtica que fizeram contra o governo atual esta revestida de p\xe9ssimas imagens da oposi\xe7\xe3o aos maranhenses, tudo foi como uma boia que vez de ficar acima do mar turbulento da pol\xedtica, ficou cheia de \xe1guas podre e depois veio a estoura ao contrario de quem deveria ser estourado. Quem recebeu toda sua estou ra\xe7\xe3o foi \xe0 oposi\xe7\xe3o que dentro deste epis\xf3dio esta a sair de forma in-complexa de dor sem resultado estrat\xe9gico na sua pr\xf3pria queda de rede.\n               Foram dias  atr\xe1s de dias que o governo do estado ficou fiscalizado e vigiado, e o seu governante totalmente desassossegado numa postura pol\xedtica de muitas reportagens a n\xedvel nacional. E por cima de tudo pediram impeachment de Roseana sem vot\xe1-lo \n             O presidente da Assembleia Legislativa do Maranh\xe3o, deputado Arnaldo Melo, - PMDB \u2014 partido ligado do governo federal e na maioria dos Estados \u2013, arquivou o pedido de impeachment contra a governadora Roseana Sarney, do mesmo partido. Com essa atitude o impeachment vai para o fundo de um ba\xfa.'

Now at least if you are cancelled you can still get insurance, even if you have a preexisting condition.    That kind of behavior by the insurance companies is exactly why we needed reform.'

message:	u'This story originally appeared on Huffington Post and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nWikiLeaks published a leaked draft of the environment chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Wednesday, and environmental groups are lining up to take a swing.The leaked documents come from a meeting of the trade deal\'s chief negotiators held in Salt Lake City, Utah, from Nov. 19 to 24, 2013. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) includes 12 countries-the United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei-and would govern a number of international environmental and trade issuesThe draft indicates the pact will include a number of promises on the environment, but will lack strong enforcement tools. "When compared against other TPP chapters, the Environment Chapter is noteworthy for its absence of mandated clauses or meaningful enforcement measures," wrote WikiLeaks in its release. The chapter is intended to deal with issues like overfishing, trade of wood products, wildlife crime, and illegal logging. But most of the measures in the chapter are voluntary, rather than binding, and do not include penalties or criminal sanctions for violations. Compliance is largely left to the respective countries.\n\nEnviros offered similar criticism. "The lack of fully-enforceable environmental safeguards means negotiators are allowing a unique opportunity to protect wildlife and support legal sustainable trade of renewable resources to slip through their fingers," said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund, in a statement.The leaked document from November is only a draft, but if the trade pact\'s final environmental chapter looks like it, it would make the Obama administration\'s environmental trade record "worse than George W. Bush\'s," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. "This draft chapter falls flat on every single one of our issues\u2013oceans, fish, wildlife, and forest protections\u2013and in fact, rolls back on the progress made in past free trade pacts."According to a report from the chairs of the TPP Environmental Working Group drafting the chapter, also released by WikiLeaks, there remains significant disagreement among the parties on many of the pact\'s provisions. The chairs wrote that Vietnam, Peru and Malaysia object to a provision calling for countries to "rationalize and phase out" fossil fuel subsidies "that encourage wasteful consumption." They also noted that the United States and Australia object to the climate change portion of the pact as it is written.Negotiation of the pact has been underway since 2010, but all discussions take place entirely outside of public view. The Obama administration has already received backlash for leaked portions of the pact that indicate it would grant greater rights to corporations to challenge national laws in private courts.\n\nEfforts to fast-track the trade deal met resistance from Democrats in Congress this week.\n\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to a request for comment on the documents.'

Found a plan with $1000 deductible and $1500 more out of pocket and low or no co pays for routine care & screening - for about $100 less than I've been paying.  Healthcare.gov allowed me to easily shop the marketplace and get the new policy - easily.  If companies have been raising their rates to ridiculous levels, blame your state insurance departments who are approving those rates.  BTW, I have twice gotten refunds of premiums because of the 80/20 rule - at least something to assure companies are spending dollars on healthcare."

message:	'..\n\nOBAMACARE ENROLLEMENT EXPLODED IN DECEMBER TO 2.2 MILLION:\n\n"The December enrollment surge for the Affordable Care Act that the Obama administration long predicted -- and desperately needed -- has come to fruition".\n\n"As of Dec. 28, 2.2 million Americans have enrolled in private health coverage, according to new data released Monday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. More than 1.8 million of them signed up in December alone, a huge spike that has gotten the law closer to its original goals than most would have thought possible after HealthCare.gov\'s disastrous rollout in October"\n\nRepublicans have had nearly 4 years at this point to come up with an alternative to Obamacare. If they were serious about reforming America\'s pathetic healthcare system, and there was such an obviously better alternative that they had (that they were willing to enact), then they would have crafted it and passed it in the House already, and they would have been pressuring the Senate and Obama to enact it.\n\nThe fact that they STILL have nothing betrays every single point they\'ve made against Obamacare, or about American health care in general since Obama took office.\n\nhttp://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/obamacare-december-enrollment-numbers'

In a letter to Congress, the White House said that Walpin was fired because he was \u201cconfused, disoriented, unable to answer questions and exhibited other behavior that led the Board to question his capacity to serve.\u201d A bipartisan group of 145 current and former public officials, attorneys, and legal scholars signed a letter that was sent to the White House, which defended Walpin, said the criticisms of him were not true, and said that his firing was politically motivated.'

Jeden Tag schnappe die NSA den Unterlagen zufolge \xfcber f\xfcnf Millionen solcher Benachrichtigungen auf. Au\xdferdem wiesen 1,6 Millionen registrierte Roaming-Nachrichten auf Grenz\xfcbertritte hin.\nIn einer internen Pr\xe4sentation beschreibt die NSA die SMS-Nachrichten als wahre \u201eGoldgrube\u201c.\nAuch der britische Dienst GCHQ soll Zugriff auf die Daten gehabt haben, um sie mit Informationen \xfcber britische B\xfcrger abgleichen zu k\xf6nnen.\nDie Enth\xfcllungs-Dokumente stammen laut \u201eGuardian\u201c aus dem Fundus des Informanten Edward Snowden und wurden 2012 von einer Seite mit Anleitungen zum \u201eDishfire\u201d-System f\xfcr GCHQ-Mitarbeiter heruntergeladen.

Am Donnerstag unterrichtete Obama bereits den britischen Premier David Cameron \xfcber seine geplante Reform.\nUS-Medien berichteten allerdings bereits im Vorfeld der Rede, Obama plane, wichtige Entscheidungen dem Kongress zu \xfcberlassen. Einerseits wolle er die Forderungen der Geheimdienste f\xfcr einen effektiven Anti-Terror-Kampf ber\xfccksichtigen. Andererseits wolle er die weltweite Emp\xf6rung d\xe4mpfen.'

message:	"Excellent analysis by economist Garrett Baldwin, Johns Hopkins University:\n\nHappy New Year from the U.S. government. Now, empty your pockets. We have to give your money to someone else.\nOn Jan. 1, the Affordable Care Act's coverage law went into effect, requiring a slew of new Obamacare taxes, fines, and fees to finance hundreds of billions in costs the government requires to operate the program. \nWelcome to the Dark Side of the Affordable Care Act, the part where we actually have to pay for all those great benefits we've been hearing about for more than three years.\nIt drives up premiums, redistributes middle-class wealth to the uninsured, and fails to achieve what should have been the primary goal of healthcare reform: Better, more affordable care for everyone."

Being sick is one thing, but being lazy is another. just another entitlement program. get off your butts and go to work and stop taking from the ones who work their butts off to have what they have. if you want to share the wealth president get your check book out and start writing checks out to those free loaders."

Most of the people signing up are being accepted by medicare, which means I am also paying for their insurance with my tax dollars. So who is funding Obamacare.  This law is a huge mistake.

If you\'re in the throes of a heart attack, treatment will commence after a full credit check is done. Of course since your medical condition makes you a high credit risk, you also won\'t mind a 27.9% interest rate on that 6-figure note. \nAfter all, if supermarkets, department stores, clothiers, and car dealers have a right to get paid before you get their product or service, health care providers should have the same right. And if you can\'t afford a Mercedes, you don\'t get to buy one. So, if you can\'t afford a visit to the ER when you have your MI, you don\'t get that ER visit.'

We all know that happy patients usually don't complete surveys but of course the angry or unhappy ones will fill out a negative survey every single time. How can we be sure to get accurate reflection of patient satisfaction if surveys are voluntary?? If they're gonna be paid in part based on patient satisfaction then it would make sense that surveys are mandatory to be completed by patients for every visit."

I advocated for the ahca when thinking it would be a positive change and i am hearing no happy campers, no one able to afford 300 to 600 + a month to have health care coverage.  Doctors offices are getting a base minimum per patient, and refusing to service the ahca and in the end no one is being helped.  This was supposed to be affordable and accessible health care coverage and a revolutionary opportunity.  Not to mention the loophole for employers who dont want to offer hc by cutting hrs under 30hrs.  Wheres the waiver for people from penalty that cant pay 600 a month who work part time and dont make enough to pay bills let alone for hc.  It was not supposed to be billed on a curve but at incredible discounts.   People have been patient with the phones and website, spend hrs signing up to no success.  Im eager to hear how this can improve immediately.  I suggest that reasonable letters be written to our representatives.  Its ok that its not perfect but lets not waste time and fix it.  This is an intelligent country and theres no reason we cant amend.  Its not political and i dont care to hear anyone subjecting our Pres. With negative comments.   Alot of people work in our government and are in positions to whom we can reach out.  Lets now take part in this team and see what can improve.  For some with ins.

message:	u'The Big Story that the Media Deliberately Missed\nPosted on Thursday, January 16, 2014 at 02:00PM\n\nThe media always misses the big stories of historic proportion. Only years later do they reluctantly admit it.\n\nHere are some examples of globally-significant stories that the anti-Christian mainstream media deliberately lost in the shuffle. The stories have to do with events in Egypt during the last few years\u2014events that I am very familiar with.\n\nIt is impossible to ascertain whether they refuse to report these stories because of their anti-Christian bias, or because the stories run contrary to the narrative propagated by the current White House. Either way, the omissions are no accident.\n\nThe Egyptian Revolution of January 2011 was fully covered\u2014every media outlet had reporters on the ground in Tahrir Square. It was a story that executive producers in New York and London could embrace with gusto: Masses of people demonstrating against a secular dictator.\n\nThe White House believed that Mubarak should be replaced by an Islamist, and the media fell right in line. The State Department had long felt that an Islamist government was inevitable, so they might as well support it now by supporting the uprising. Even the European Union, to pacify its burgeoning Islamist population, got on the bandwagon.\n\nBut we all know the results now:\n\n    The Obama Administration got its wish and Mubarak resigned.\n    An Islamist, Mohamed Morsi, ran for president, even though he was in prison at the time of the revolution and illegally broke out.\n    Through a series of campaign lies, Morsi was elected, despite only receiving 11 million votes out of a population of 90 million.\n    The Muslim Brotherhood members who advised President Obama propagated a message of \u201cdemocracy in our time\u201d to the Western media.\n    The media ran with the story: \u201cThe First Democratically Elected President in Egyptian History.\u201d That sounded good to the uninformed. \n\nThen soon after Morsi get into office, he declared himself a dictator and above the law. Did we hear even the softest grumble of opposition from the White House or other Western capitals? No, not a word.\n\nWithin twelve months of Morsi\u2019s reign, Egypt was brought to its knees economically, socially, and politically. A result far more disastrous than anything its secular predecessor could have possibly accomplished.\n\nBut the media covered up that disaster. Why? It didn\u2019t fit the narrative. The White House and its aligned media executives believed Islamists would be good for Egypt and good for the Middle East.\n\nThen came June 30, 2013, when more than 30 million people, from all walks of life and religious persuasions, angrily demanded new elections. But dictators, especially Islamist dictators (as we have seen with Hamas), detest re-elections.\n\nThus when the army acted as steward of stability and stood by the protesters (the size of the mass protests were unprecedented in human history), the White House condemned the army\u2019s action as a military coup. In order to punish Egypt, Obama took the law into his own hands and cut aid to Egypt\u2014aid that was agreed to back at the 1978 Camp David Accords.\n\nBut there\u2019s even another big story that the media missed.\n\nDuring the twelve months of the Islamist dictatorship, the Christian minority, which numbers between 10 and 17 million, were openly persecuted. Throughout the Islamist reign, they went to their churches in enormous numbers, packing them for prayer meetings. Some of those prayer meetings witnessed thousands upon thousands of people praying 24/7\u2014crying out to God to hear their pleas.\n\nEven many non-Christians believe that the demise of the Muslim Brotherhood government came as a direct answer to the prayers of those believers. But try explaining that to the BBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, or CNN.\n\nOf course, the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood punished the Christians by burning many of their churches, homes, and businesses. Yet the Christians saw that as a small price to pay for a better future for their country.\n\nBut here\u2019s the biggest story that the media kept locked away:\n\nDuring the recent Christmas and New Year celebrations in Egypt, the interim president, Adly Mansour, went to the Coptic Cathedral. There, he met and embraced the patriarch and expressed the good wishes of all Egyptians for Christmas and the New Year.\n\nThat had never happened before in the past 1,400 years of majority-Islamic rule.\n\nThat meeting was of great significance, not only for Egypt or the region, but for all Muslims who are truly moderates. It was a gesture that can help to ultimately fulfill the dreams of all peace-loving people.\n\nBut the media deliberately ignored that possible world-impacting and future-altering event.\n\nWill those who control most of the dissemination of news in the West ever turn back to the honest and transparent reporting of such history-making events? Unfortunately, I doubt it.'

message:	'"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America\'s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.  It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills.  It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government\'s reckless fiscal policies.  Increasing America\'s debt weakens us domestically and internationally.  Leadership means that, \'the buck stops here.\'  Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.  America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership.  Americans deserve better."    ~ Senator Barack H.  Obama, March 2006'

message:	'Funny, there was a story in the Times (yes, not Fox, but the NY Times) about a woman who was one of Obama\'s most zealous ACA supporters until she actually signed up and was charged far more after her rate was changed without her consent.  I\'m neither Dem nor Rep, but this petty "us vs. them" bickering has to stop if we ever want to get our nation on a better track.  This blaming of Bush for Obama\'s mistakes is pathetic, especially - 8 years of one bad President does not mean we need another 8 years of another bad President.  And Republicans, think about why you\'re so angry now, and so quick to hate him and give him zero credit; the man might be a con man, or he might just be naive... hell, his plans might actually even work.  Now, I\'m with the economists who flat out say it won\'t, as I put my faith in mathematics, but that\'s the thing - this isn\'t an issue of "Red vs. Blue", this is an issue of doing what we think is best for the nation in all ways.  And I repeat "in all ways" - bankrupting future generations so that we can have 10 years of healthcare is not worth it in the long run, and is ultimately terrible for our nation.  Think about the future.  I find many Progressives care about the environment and the future of the planet, but fail to think about the future of the nation and economy - a child is just as likely to die from hunger from poverty as he or she is from poison air from pollution.\n\nOk, rant over, I\'m now ready to be called a "commy faget" and "republiCON faux news bible thumper" :P'

message:	"Tina 600$ a month is amazingly affordable for us! It's good to know that, if for some reason our income dropped, we would be eligible for subsidies.  A few days ago, I was telling people how , about 5 years ago, I was forced to make  a really hard decision.  I had cancer and had insurance at the time.  It wasn't great insurance, but it paid for some of the surgery.  Then, since I couldn't get the chemo/radiation therapy without going 350 miles from my home for a month and a half, I was forced to decide between my treatment and insurance.  It would have cost me 2000$ a month to keep my insurance, and I had to leave my job.  I chose to live.  I paid for the treatments out of pocket. I didn't go bankrupt like a lot of people do, but I was financially devastated.  I lived in fear that my cancer might come back, and this time I simply couldn't afford treatment.  Now, for the first time since I had to drop my insurance, I am covered.  Not only am I covered, I was covered for less than I have been paying every month for medications that I can now get for a modest co-pay.  I have been able to quit my job and am giving respite care to a family member with an autistic child.  ( and don't worry, I'm still not getting a subsidy)."

Perhaps if the republicans could have come up with a viable replacement people would have agreed.  All they've done was obstruct and repeal. You are certainly entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts.  Stop laughing, you might give yourself a hernia and need Obamacare."

message:	u"Greta Van Susteren\n\nPresident Obama -- and prior Presidents -- love to use SECRET courts. First, I don't know how they can call them courts since they are one sided and no one knows what happens in them. Secret courts are a really bad idea. To the extent something needs to be kept from the public (and it should be extremely rare), a routine court can close the doors and go into a closed session. But...at some point - whether it be in one month or 5 years - the minutes from that closed hearing should be released. Even the most secret matters at the moment at some point in time become non urgent, and simply history - and a chance for us to police our government (even if it is looking back at time.) Keeping matters secret should not be routine -- and in DC, it is. There are so many documents that the government (and this has been going on for decades) stamps classified that should not be. I think classified is an easy way for the government to hide things from you. Sure, some things should be classified, but not all...and there does come a time when even a classified document is no longer national security. Perfect example? The August 12, 2013 cable from Benghazi consulate to the State Department. There is no reason to keep that cable under wraps - it should be declassified (and if there is one thing in it that should be classified, just redact that part until a future date...but the whole document should not be kept under wraps with a classified document stamp. Our government needs to be reminded from time to time, that we are an open nation, and that the government employees work for us and not the other way around. Yes, some matters should be classified and secret...but certainly not as much as they have been doing. And..to get back to the secret courts, that's a bad idea. It is one sided..and you never get to hear what is argued or decided...and you sure don't have anyone advocating for you there.\n\nLike \xb7  \xb7 Share \xb7 2,488257510 \xb7 10 hours ago \xb7"

Since millions are dropped every year around Jan 1st, this isn't anything new.  In fact this level of fuckery by the insurance companies is a good reason we need the protection the ACA provides.

He knows nothing about anything, an he is not responsible for nothing! Everything that has happened under his watch is someone else's fault..... That's complete BS!!!!

message:	'"My party is full of racists.\n\nOct 2012\n\nThe Republican Party is full of Racists\n\n"Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, a self-identified Republican who was Gen. Colin Powell\'s chief of staff during his time as secretary of state, did not take too kindly to a recent accusation -- from Mitt Romney\'s controversial campaign co-chair John Sununu -- that Powell only endorsed Barack Obama for president because they\'re both black. Sununu would later backtrack, but the damage was done.\n\nWilkerson, who is white, didn\'t mince words on MSNBC\'sThe Ed Show Friday night. "To say that Colin Powell would endorse President Obama because of his skin color is like saying Mother Teresa worked for profit," he said. And although he gave Sununu a bit of a pass, blaming his statement on an "unfortunate" choice of words, Wilkerson had much harsher words for the GOP as a whole.\n\n"Let me just be candid," he said. "My party is full of racists. And the real reason a considerable portion of my party wants President Obama out of the White House has nothing to do with the content of his character, nothing to do with his competence as commander in chief and president, and everything to do with the color of his skin. And that\'s despicable." from the Root webpage http://www.theroot.com/buzz/former-powell-chief-st'

message:	u'Accomplishments by the Obama Administration...1. Passed Health Care Reform: After five presidents over a century failed to create universal health insurance, signed the Affordable Care Act (2010). It will cover 32 million uninsured Americans beginning in 2014 and mandates a suite of experimental measures to cut health care cost growth, the number one cause of America\u2019s long-term fiscal problems.\n\n2. Passed the Stimulus: Signed $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid greatest recession since the Great Depression. Weeks after stimulus went into effect, unemployment claims began to subside. Twelve months later, the private sector began producing more jobs than it was losing, and it has continued to do so for twenty-three straight months, creating a total of nearly 3.7 million new private-sector jobs.\n\n3. Passed Wall Street Reform: Signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) to re-regulate the financial sector after its practices caused the Great Recession. The new law tightens capital requirements on large banks and other financial institutions, requires derivatives to be sold on clearinghouses and exchanges, mandates that large banks provide \u201cliving wills\u201d to avoid chaotic bankruptcies, limits their ability to trade with customers\u2019 money for their own profit, and creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (now headed by Richard Cordray) to crack down on abusive lending products and companies.\n\n4. Ended the War in Iraq: Ordered all U.S. military forces out of the country. Last troops left on December 18, 2011.'

message:	u'Obama did what? 11. Told Mubarak to Go: On February 1, 2011, publicly called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to accept reform or step down, thus weakening the dictator\u2019s position and putting America on the right side of the Arab Spring. Mubarak ended thirty-year rule when overthrown on February 11.\n\n12. Reversed Bush Torture Policies: Two days after taking office, nullified Bush-era rulings that had allowed detainees in U.S. custody to undergo certain \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques considered inhumane under the Geneva Conventions. Also released the secret Bush legal rulings supporting the use of these techniques.\n\n13. Improved America\u2019s Image Abroad: With new policies, diplomacy, and rhetoric, reversed a sharp decline in world opinion toward the U.S. (and the corresponding loss of \u201csoft power\u201d) during the Bush years. From 2008 to 2011, favorable opinion toward the United States rose in ten of fifteen countries surveyed by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, with an average increase of 26 percent.\n\n14. Kicked Banks Out of Federal Student Loan Program, Expanded Pell Grant Spending: As part of the 2010 health care reform bill, signed measure ending the wasteful decades-old practice of subsidizing banks to provide college loans. Starting July 2010 all students began getting their federal student loans directly from the federal government. Treasury will save $67 billion over ten years, $36 billion of which will go to expanding Pell Grants to lower-income students.\n\n15. Created Race to the Top: With funds from stimulus, started $4.35 billion program of competitive grants to encourage and reward states for education reform.\n\n16. Boosted Fuel Efficiency Standards: Released new fuel efficiency standards in 2011 that will nearly double the fuel economy for cars and trucks by 2025.'

Coordinated International Response to Financial Crisis: To keep world economy out of recession in 2009 and 2010, helped secure from G-20 nations more than $500 billion for the IMF to provide lines of credit and other support to emerging market countries, which kept them liquid and avoided crises with their currencies.\n\n18. Passed Mini Stimuli: To help families hurt by the recession and spur the economy as stimulus spending declined, signed series of measures (July 22, 2010; December 17, 2010; December 23, 2011) to extend unemployment insurance and cut payroll taxes.\n\n19. Began Asia \u201cPivot\u201d: In 2011, reoriented American military and diplomatic priorities and focus from the Middle East and Europe to the Asian-Pacific region. Executed multipronged strategy of positively engaging China while reasserting U.S. leadership in the region by increasing American military presence and crafting new commercial, diplomatic, and military alliances with neighboring countries made uncomfortable by recent Chinese behavior.\n\n20. Increased Support for Veterans: With so many soldiers coming home from Iraq and Iran with serious physical and mental health problems, yet facing long waits for services, increased 2010 Department of Veterans Affairs budget by 16 percent and 2011 budget by 10 percent. Also signed new GI bill offering $78 billion in tuition assistance over a decade, and provided multiple tax credits to encourage businesses to hire veterans.\n\n21. Tightened Sanctions on Iran: In effort to deter Iran\u2019s nuclear program, signed Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (2010) to punish firms and individuals who aid Iran\u2019s petroleum sector. In late 2011 and early 2012, coordinated with other major Western powers to impose sanctions aimed at Iran\u2019s banks and with Japan, South Korea, and China to shift their oil purchases away from Iran.'

message:	u'Obama did this too....22. Created Conditions to Begin Closing Dirtiest Power Plants: New EPA restrictions on mercury and toxic pollution, issued in December 2011, likely to lead to the closing of between sixty-eight and 231 of the nation\u2019s oldest and dirtiest coal-fired power plants. Estimated cost to utilities: at least $11 billion by 2016. Estimated health benefits: $59 billion to $140 billion. Will also significantly reduce carbon emissions and, with other regulations, comprises what\u2019s been called Obama\u2019s \u201cstealth climate policy.\u201d\n\n23. Passed Credit Card Reforms: Signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (2009), which prohibits credit card companies from raising rates without advance notification, mandates a grace period on interest rate increases, and strictly limits overdraft and other fees.\n\n24. Eliminated Catch-22 in Pay Equality Laws: Signed Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, giving women who are paid less than men for the same work the right to sue their employers after they find out about the discrimination, even if that discrimination happened years ago. Under previous law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the statute of limitations on such suits ran out 180 days after the alleged discrimination occurred, even if the victims never knew about it.\n\n25. Protected Two Liberal Seats on the U.S. Supreme Court: Nominated and obtained confirmation for Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic and third woman to serve, in 2009; and Elena Kagan, the fourth woman to serve, in 2010. They replaced David Souter and John Paul Stevens, respectively.'

Expanded National Service: Signed Serve America Act in 2009, which authorized a tripling of the size of AmeriCorps. Program grew 13 percent to 85,000 members across the country by 2012, when new House GOP majority refused to appropriate more funds for further expansion.\n\n29. Expanded Wilderness and Watershed Protection: Signed Omnibus Public Lands Management Act (2009), which designated more than 2 million acres as wilderness, created thousands of miles of recreational and historic trails, and protected more than 1,000 miles of rivers.\n\n30. Gave the FDA Power to Regulate Tobacco: Signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (2009). Nine years in the making and long resisted by the tobacco industry, the law mandates that tobacco manufacturers disclose all ingredients, obtain FDA approval for new tobacco products, and expand the size and prominence of cigarette warning labels, and bans the sale of misleadingly labeled \u201clight\u201d cigarette brands and tobacco sponsorship of entertainment events.\n\n31. Pushed Federal Agencies to Be Green Leaders: Issued executive order in 2009 requiring all federal agencies to make plans to soften their environmental impacts by 2020. Goals include 30 percent reduction in fleet gasoline use, 26 percent boost in water efficiency, and sustainability requirements for 95 percent of all federal contracts. Because federal government is the country\u2019s single biggest purchaser of goods and services, likely to have ripple effects throughout the economy for years to come.'

Began Post-Post-9/11 Military Builddown: After winning agreement from congressional Republicans and Democrats in summer 2011 budget deal to reduce projected defense spending by $450 billion, proposed new DoD budget this year with cuts of that size and a new national defense strategy that would shrink ground forces from 570,000 to 490,000 over the next ten years while increasing programs in intelligence gathering and cyberwarfare.\n\n35. Let Space Shuttle Die and Killed Planned Moon Mission: Allowed the expensive ($1 billion per launch), badly designed, dangerous shuttle program to make its final launch on July 8, 2011. Cut off funding for even more bloated and problem-plagued Bush-era Constellation program to build moon base in favor of support for private-sector low-earth orbit ventures, research on new rocket technologies for long-distance manned flight missions, and unmanned space exploration, including the largest interplanetary rover ever launched, which will investigate Mars\u2019s potential to support life.\n\n36. Invested Heavily in Renewable Technology: As part of the 2009 stimulus, invested $90 billion, more than any previous administration, in research on smart grids, energy efficiency, electric cars, renewable electricity generation, cleaner coal, and biofuels.'

This isn't free I paid copay all these years and deductibles ! Quit complaining if you go to the ER twice or 3 times a year your debt would be higher then insurance ?"

message:	"My health insurance is over $600 a month. It started out around $300 and over the years it's been upped and upped and upped. I'm waiting for a letter from the new insurance company - but with Obama's plan I would be on a much better health plan and be saving nearly TWO HUNDRED a month. (Before Obamacare I tried to switch to another health insurance company and I was denied because of my health problems.) I can't live without the medications I take. I have a steady job. I pay my taxes. For those who think Obamacare is useless/etc - maybe you should stop thinking of yourselves and try to think of the other people out there who need help. There are people like me who work their butts off but can't afford $150+ every time they go to the pharmacy (and that's WITH insurance.) Stop thinking about yourselves and try - for a moment, if you can - to think about the other human beings you share this country with. Stop being so freaking selfish for a change."

Congress is going to allow all the illegals to collect on theirs! If you are young, just have plenty of babies. If you don't want to denounce your citizenship.,just start using a SSN that is NOT your own. You don't need one to get employment. Once you are hired just make one up! You can sue your employer if they fire you for this. You can develop a credit report with a fake SSN. Then go work some where else using a different SSN. Make sure you do a change of address and new phone number. Goodness don't pay back those high interest credit cards. I am writing a book on how to beat the system!  You can even avoid child support garnishment! When 2 illegal Hispanics used their names but my husband's SSN they taught me how to screw everyone and guess what! The federal government doesn't care! Google Robert Guenterberg. By the way, when you retire just walk into your local SSA office and show your real SSN card. The SSA will take everything out of their Social Security Suspense Earning file and you can collect your retirement."

I am being sent to a clinic and pay their price for doctors plus meds. Just for one that I needed on Monday, I spent 40 dls. And it was a generic. I have written to you, like now, many times. No one pays attention to the "gray" people like me. The ones that don\'t fit: 63 year olds, not making enough and not getting Medicare or Medicaid...I have an application number. I hope I don\'t get fined, on top of all this!'

I went through the process and my husband and I now have healthcare that we can afford and that comes with a primary care doctor and routine treatment for my diabetes.

What is the point of having some of the best Health Care in the world if it\'s not made available to the sick?'

message:	'To whoever has a chance to read my messages\n\nThis is my perspective point of view only. It is not intend to be on any side except for my beloved King of Thailand.\n\nI am writing to you all about the problems that have been long term issues in Thailand, the land of smile, sincereness, and kindness country. The problem where people are fighting for their right to make Thailand change to be a better country for our children who will grow up to be adults who are responsible for our country.\n\nI believe in Thailand have occurs to be separate in four groups. One is group of people who support a better future politic. People who are stepping out to fight for all of us. To fight, hope, pray and believe for a better quality, fairness, and sincereness new pry minister. People who love our King so much and would like to fight for our future country for a better place to live for our children.\nSecond group is the group of people who are standing up for the ex-pry minister names Taksin Chinnawat. We believe those group of people who care to be on his side are manageable, controllable by the power of his billionaire money . Some who fight for him have a believe in term of think that if i support him, he will be the one to help me make more money because Taksin is a business man. He knows how to be a good business, but he failed to be a great pry minister at that time. We elected him to be a pry minister of Thailand in term of hoping he will be the one. The one who did not corrupt our money since he had been so rich already.The one who we believe to work hard to improve Thailand for a more civilized country. He was using our trust to destroy our country for his own good sake. He used his power to create a system called Taksin system where everywhere he went, everything he did were just to make him richer and richer. Some of people who joined his group had been tighten by money and business only. Some people who support him are people from countryside or people who accept his money to come fight for his power.\nThe third group is the group of people who do not care anything about our country. Not only that they enjoy making the situation get worse. They has not been standing up on any side , but for themselves.\nThe last group is the group who does not standing up on any side and tend to be does not care about anything either they have busy lives making more money or busy lives taking care their own business. What they do only upset about all the fights that occur in Thailand.\nAbout the protests that have been occurring in Thailand. For me, I am standing up for my King and Queen. I am standing up for a better future country for our children who will become quality adult in the future. I am standing up to destroy Taksin Chinnawat system who had have his sister Yinglak, pry minister of Thailand to be his own doll who he had been controlling behind the scene. I hope and pray for all of you, Thai Citizen who spend your valuable time to fight for me and for all of us. I am standing up for a true democracy in Thailand, not Communist.\nI am hoping and praying for one day, we will have a better Pry Minister who really care about Thai citizen more than himself. The Pry Minister who is a hard working, sincere, kind and care enough for all of us. The Pry Minister who is not care to make more money by his power for his own good sake. The chosen one who cares about our poor people.\nThere are ton of people who live on the street with no foods, clothes, nothing.\nPry Minister who sincerely love our Thai people just like how our king love his citizen.\nOur King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been working so hard all his life for his citizen. He work for no money. He cares for his citizen unconditionally.\nHe works so hard to improve our country for a more civilized place for all of his citizen. He had done many projects to help so many farmers in Thailand have a better lives. He has taught them many ways to improve a better quality and efficiency farms and products, so they can have a better lives. What he has done to all of us are not something that I can write here and finish it in one day. There are no words to describe enough how wonderful king he is. All I know is I love and respect my King very much from the bottom of my heart. I will do every way to make him happy. I will support whoever stand up on our king side. I will do every way I can to fight to whoever try to make my King unhappy.\n\nThis is a message from me Jutinut Suwanpathumlerd to Yinklak Chinawat and his brother Taksin Chinnawat.\n\nGO TO HELL\n\nYou are not belong to Thailand. You do not deserve to stand on the land where our King has work so hard for his citizen.\n\nOur country is not a country for your business, good sake and selfish.\n\nAgain just one writing will not be enough to describe how bad they are.\n\nYinkluck, go to hell. You do not deserve to have a power in Thailand if you can not use your power in a way for others, not for herself and her family. You guys are rich enough!!!\n\nGet out and go to hell. You and your stupid sister are not Thai citizen. You are not belong to Thailand.\n\nI apologize if my writing here would hurt anyone feeling.\nI apologize for my poor english skills if i made any mistake here.\n\nI do not apologize to Taksin, Yinklak and their supports group.'

My individual plan was no longer accepted & I was told I had to go find a group plan. I will be taking a loss of $4,500 as I was on a MRP from my employer. The group plan they are forcing me into is $1782 per quarter, up from $695 I WAS paying. This all happened because they, "Had to pass the bill, so that they could find out what is in it".

message:	"The insurance companies are not going to go broke.  They would be insane to deny people treatment. They did not discontinue policies because they couldn't afford to comply with the ACA. Here's why :The insurance companies are allowed to make no more than 20% profit now because of the law. It does not matter how much prices go up or down, they will not make more or be forced to take less.  If the they choose to insure more people , they will make 20% on more policies.  They make 20% on the crappy policies, and they make 20% on the Cadillac policies.  So it wasn't exactly the cost increase for them to provide better insurance that caused them to drop people. It is more about hoping people will get rid of their lowball insurance plans and go for a bigger one.  Now if people get more expensive insurance, they will get 20% of a larger amount.  If a person requires $100 for treatment, they will make $20.  If the person requires $10,000 treatment, they will make $2,000. The extra actual costs of the insurance will be passed along to the consumer.  No downside for the insurance companies at this point.  The lobbied FOR the ACA The upside to this is that it appears to be working.  Medical spending has ALWAYS increased, but this year it increased the least that it has in 50 years!"

message:	'The economic inequality in this country is just the tip of the iceberg considering that fact that those who are placed in high powered positions like cooperate banks, IMF want to divide wealth while destabilizing communities that creates a profit of prosperity for families. they destroy industrial profits by allowing those who control government to interfere with applicable opportunity, knowing that they households can make a profit managing their own economy. I don\'t dislike capitalism but I really wish that it didn\'t divide and conquer like it does, meaning that corporations who believe in it should be less selfish and be more into dynamism.\n2 minutes ago\n"Poverty is the ill definition of a hell condition, lack of prosperity and fortune and the money we spend on war should go to those who are living in it. if only money didn\'t overrule our democracy pro-capitalistically like international federal reserve banking systems, we\'d all be rich. forget corporations overhauling people who work minimum wage, why don\'t you don\'t deliver the solution, instead of using government interference to block applicability from reaching it\'s maximum. defense spending is useless, just like pumping billions into the economy considering the fact, that quantitative easing should never be used again because it undermines the debt, consumer price index with the value of economic recuperation and what the currency creates".'

A 5 page bill could have taken care of the rest, but Obamacare was never about healthcare.  It's always been a data mining ponzi scheme, designed to redistribute the wealth. I heard on the radio today liberals crowing about Canadian healthcare. 2 problems with comparing us to Canada. 1-the sick in Canada aren't crowing about their healthcare.  Wait times to see specialists is 2 to 3 times longer than in the US. 2- Although Canada is a large country land wise, its population is less than California. I'm guessing it's a little easier to manage the healthcare needs on a state level than this one size fits few, national monstrosity."

message:	u'Dreamin, Embassy attacks?  Bush and Clinton both suffered it BUT...the answer is actually pretty simple: yeah, there were x-number of embassy attacks under Bush and they did not require investigations. For that matter there were all of these attacks on embassies and American interests under President Clinton, and they didn\u2019t require investigations, either.  Why not? Well, because under Bush the embassy attacks were taking place mostly in Iraq, and during a time of acknowledged war \u2014 right in the thick of it, in fact \u2014 and no one tried to argue that they were anything but planned and executed attacks.   And during the Clinton years, the attacks \u2014 which took place an average of every 18 months \u2014 were recognized as planned, organized attacks and no one tried to argue that they were anything different, either.  And while our embassies were attacked under these presidents, and others, none of our Ambassadors were murdered (along with Navy Seals) while multiple stand-down orders were given against mounting a rescue.  Neither the Bush nor Clinton administrations sought to mischaracterize the attacks on their embassies. Neither of them disseminated weirdly vague stories that was \u201creally\u201d took place was a spontaneous protest over an unseen, stupid video. And it was not the Bush (or Clinton) administration that \u2014 even after acknowledging a terror attack had occurred \u2014 repeated those lies to grieving parents or (weeks later) in a speech to the UN where the \u201cvideo\u201d was blamed six times.   See there is a difference, Bush, Clinton even Reagan had these issues BUT...Benghazi...well read it for yourself.'

message:	"My health insurance is over $600 a month. It started out around $300 and over the years it's been upped and upped and upped. I'm waiting for a letter from the new insurance company - but with Obama's plan I would be on a much better health plan and be saving nearly TWO HUNDRED a month. (Before Obamacare I tried to switch to another health insurance company and I was denied because of my health problems.) I can't live without the medications I take. I have a steady job. I pay my taxes. For those who think Obamacare is useless/etc - maybe you should stop thinking of yourselves and try to think of the other people out there who need help. There are people like me who work their butts off but can't afford $150+ every time they go to the pharmacy (and that's WITH insurance.) Stop thinking about yourselves and try - for a moment, if you can - to think about the other human beings you share this country with. Stop being so freaking selfish for a change."

Congress is going to allow all the illegals to collect on theirs! If you are young, just have plenty of babies. If you don't want to denounce your citizenship.,just start using a SSN that is NOT your own. You don't need one to get employment. Once you are hired just make one up! You can sue your employer if they fire you for this. You can develop a credit report with a fake SSN. Then go work some where else using a different SSN. Make sure you do a change of address and new phone number. Goodness don't pay back those high interest credit cards. I am writing a book on how to beat the system!  You can even avoid child support garnishment! When 2 illegal Hispanics used their names but my husband's SSN they taught me how to screw everyone and guess what! The federal government doesn't care! Google Robert Guenterberg. By the way, when you retire just walk into your local SSA office and show your real SSN card. The SSA will take everything out of their Social Security Suspense Earning file and you can collect your retirement."

I am being sent to a clinic and pay their price for doctors plus meds. Just for one that I needed on Monday, I spent 40 dls. And it was a generic. I have written to you, like now, many times. No one pays attention to the "gray" people like me. The ones that don\'t fit: 63 year olds, not making enough and not getting Medicare or Medicaid...I have an application number. I hope I don\'t get fined, on top of all this!'

I went through the process and my husband and I now have healthcare that we can afford and that comes with a primary care doctor and routine treatment for my diabetes.

What is the point of having some of the best Health Care in the world if it\'s not made available to the sick?'

message:	'To whoever has a chance to read my messages\n\nThis is my perspective point of view only. It is not intend to be on any side except for my beloved King of Thailand.\n\nI am writing to you all about the problems that have been long term issues in Thailand, the land of smile, sincereness, and kindness country. The problem where people are fighting for their right to make Thailand change to be a better country for our children who will grow up to be adults who are responsible for our country.\n\nI believe in Thailand have occurs to be separate in four groups. One is group of people who support a better future politic. People who are stepping out to fight for all of us. To fight, hope, pray and believe for a better quality, fairness, and sincereness new pry minister. People who love our King so much and would like to fight for our future country for a better place to live for our children.\nSecond group is the group of people who are standing up for the ex-pry minister names Taksin Chinnawat. We believe those group of people who care to be on his side are manageable, controllable by the power of his billionaire money . Some who fight for him have a believe in term of think that if i support him, he will be the one to help me make more money because Taksin is a business man. He knows how to be a good business, but he failed to be a great pry minister at that time. We elected him to be a pry minister of Thailand in term of hoping he will be the one. The one who did not corrupt our money since he had been so rich already.The one who we believe to work hard to improve Thailand for a more civilized country. He was using our trust to destroy our country for his own good sake. He used his power to create a system called Taksin system where everywhere he went, everything he did were just to make him richer and richer. Some of people who joined his group had been tighten by money and business only. Some people who support him are people from countryside or people who accept his money to come fight for his power.\nThe third group is the group of people who do not care anything about our country. Not only that they enjoy making the situation get worse. They has not been standing up on any side , but for themselves.\nThe last group is the group who does not standing up on any side and tend to be does not care about anything either they have busy lives making more money or busy lives taking care their own business. What they do only upset about all the fights that occur in Thailand.\nAbout the protests that have been occurring in Thailand. For me, I am standing up for my King and Queen. I am standing up for a better future country for our children who will become quality adult in the future. I am standing up to destroy Taksin Chinnawat system who had have his sister Yinglak, pry minister of Thailand to be his own doll who he had been controlling behind the scene. I hope and pray for all of you, Thai Citizen who spend your valuable time to fight for me and for all of us. I am standing up for a true democracy in Thailand, not Communist.\nI am hoping and praying for one day, we will have a better Pry Minister who really care about Thai citizen more than himself. The Pry Minister who is a hard working, sincere, kind and care enough for all of us. The Pry Minister who is not care to make more money by his power for his own good sake. The chosen one who cares about our poor people.\nThere are ton of people who live on the street with no foods, clothes, nothing.\nPry Minister who sincerely love our Thai people just like how our king love his citizen.\nOur King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been working so hard all his life for his citizen. He work for no money. He cares for his citizen unconditionally.\nHe works so hard to improve our country for a more civilized place for all of his citizen. He had done many projects to help so many farmers in Thailand have a better lives. He has taught them many ways to improve a better quality and efficiency farms and products, so they can have a better lives. What he has done to all of us are not something that I can write here and finish it in one day. There are no words to describe enough how wonderful king he is. All I know is I love and respect my King very much from the bottom of my heart. I will do every way to make him happy. I will support whoever stand up on our king side. I will do every way I can to fight to whoever try to make my King unhappy.\n\nThis is a message from me Jutinut Suwanpathumlerd to Yinklak Chinawat and his brother Taksin Chinnawat.\n\nGO TO HELL\n\nYou are not belong to Thailand. You do not deserve to stand on the land where our King has work so hard for his citizen.\n\nOur country is not a country for your business, good sake and selfish.\n\nAgain just one writing will not be enough to describe how bad they are.\n\nYinkluck, go to hell. You do not deserve to have a power in Thailand if you can not use your power in a way for others, not for herself and her family. You guys are rich enough!!!\n\nGet out and go to hell. You and your stupid sister are not Thai citizen. You are not belong to Thailand.\n\nI apologize if my writing here would hurt anyone feeling.\nI apologize for my poor english skills if i made any mistake here.\n\nI do not apologize to Taksin, Yinklak and their supports group.'

My individual plan was no longer accepted & I was told I had to go find a group plan. I will be taking a loss of $4,500 as I was on a MRP from my employer. The group plan they are forcing me into is $1782 per quarter, up from $695 I WAS paying. This all happened because they, "Had to pass the bill, so that they could find out what is in it".

message:	"The insurance companies are not going to go broke.  They would be insane to deny people treatment. They did not discontinue policies because they couldn't afford to comply with the ACA. Here's why :The insurance companies are allowed to make no more than 20% profit now because of the law. It does not matter how much prices go up or down, they will not make more or be forced to take less.  If the they choose to insure more people , they will make 20% on more policies.  They make 20% on the crappy policies, and they make 20% on the Cadillac policies.  So it wasn't exactly the cost increase for them to provide better insurance that caused them to drop people. It is more about hoping people will get rid of their lowball insurance plans and go for a bigger one.  Now if people get more expensive insurance, they will get 20% of a larger amount.  If a person requires $100 for treatment, they will make $20.  If the person requires $10,000 treatment, they will make $2,000. The extra actual costs of the insurance will be passed along to the consumer.  No downside for the insurance companies at this point.  The lobbied FOR the ACA The upside to this is that it appears to be working.  Medical spending has ALWAYS increased, but this year it increased the least that it has in 50 years!"

message:	'The economic inequality in this country is just the tip of the iceberg considering that fact that those who are placed in high powered positions like cooperate banks, IMF want to divide wealth while destabilizing communities that creates a profit of prosperity for families. they destroy industrial profits by allowing those who control government to interfere with applicable opportunity, knowing that they households can make a profit managing their own economy. I don\'t dislike capitalism but I really wish that it didn\'t divide and conquer like it does, meaning that corporations who believe in it should be less selfish and be more into dynamism.\n2 minutes ago\n"Poverty is the ill definition of a hell condition, lack of prosperity and fortune and the money we spend on war should go to those who are living in it. if only money didn\'t overrule our democracy pro-capitalistically like international federal reserve banking systems, we\'d all be rich. forget corporations overhauling people who work minimum wage, why don\'t you don\'t deliver the solution, instead of using government interference to block applicability from reaching it\'s maximum. defense spending is useless, just like pumping billions into the economy considering the fact, that quantitative easing should never be used again because it undermines the debt, consumer price index with the value of economic recuperation and what the currency creates".'

A 5 page bill could have taken care of the rest, but Obamacare was never about healthcare.  It's always been a data mining ponzi scheme, designed to redistribute the wealth. I heard on the radio today liberals crowing about Canadian healthcare. 2 problems with comparing us to Canada. 1-the sick in Canada aren't crowing about their healthcare.  Wait times to see specialists is 2 to 3 times longer than in the US. 2- Although Canada is a large country land wise, its population is less than California. I'm guessing it's a little easier to manage the healthcare needs on a state level than this one size fits few, national monstrosity."

message:	u'Dreamin, Embassy attacks?  Bush and Clinton both suffered it BUT...the answer is actually pretty simple: yeah, there were x-number of embassy attacks under Bush and they did not require investigations. For that matter there were all of these attacks on embassies and American interests under President Clinton, and they didn\u2019t require investigations, either.  Why not? Well, because under Bush the embassy attacks were taking place mostly in Iraq, and during a time of acknowledged war \u2014 right in the thick of it, in fact \u2014 and no one tried to argue that they were anything but planned and executed attacks.   And during the Clinton years, the attacks \u2014 which took place an average of every 18 months \u2014 were recognized as planned, organized attacks and no one tried to argue that they were anything different, either.  And while our embassies were attacked under these presidents, and others, none of our Ambassadors were murdered (along with Navy Seals) while multiple stand-down orders were given against mounting a rescue.  Neither the Bush nor Clinton administrations sought to mischaracterize the attacks on their embassies. Neither of them disseminated weirdly vague stories that was \u201creally\u201d took place was a spontaneous protest over an unseen, stupid video. And it was not the Bush (or Clinton) administration that \u2014 even after acknowledging a terror attack had occurred \u2014 repeated those lies to grieving parents or (weeks later) in a speech to the UN where the \u201cvideo\u201d was blamed six times.   See there is a difference, Bush, Clinton even Reagan had these issues BUT...Benghazi...well read it for yourself.'

message:	u'After the Affordable Care Act, 2010 "ObamaCare" is fully implemented with the new state exchanges and fine-tuned; it will join the ranks of Social Security and Medicare as the three best anti-poverty programs ever enacted into law in the country. Health care account for 18% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. There are 48.6 million uninsured Americans according to the 2012 census, and 37% of all uninsured Americans have household incomes above $50,000. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spent more on health care per capita ($8,608), and more on health care as percentage of its GDP than any other nation in 2012. The Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries, and notes U.S. care costs the most. In a 2013 ranking of nations with the most efficient health care systems, the United States ranks 46th among the 48 countries included in the study. Recent evidence demonstrates that lack of health insurance causes some 45,000 to 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States. In 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses. A 2013 study found that about 25% of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 43% are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence. In some states, over a quarter of the population is uninsured, including 6 million in Texas. In addition to having the highest rate of people without health insurance in the nation, Texas also has the largest number of children without health insurance and the highest rate of poor adults without health insurance, according to 2012 American Community Survey estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2012. So; would you prefer people use the emergency room for their primary health care and the most expensive with the least wellness outcome; or do you want affordable health care for all that would bend the cost curve and force people to take some personal responsibility for their health care? Where is the Republican/Tea Party alternative health care plan that would keep Americans out of the emergency room? \nkeep in mind that \'taxpayers\' subsidize the uninsured by an average $1,100 in federal taxes every year. Hospitals absorb some of the costs which lead to high rates for patients, and higher premium costs for private insurance policies. Private health care insurance will continue to exist in the country, although policies were often substandard before the Affordable Care Act, 2010...and the most expensive in the world. One key in reaching the goal of universal coverage is making uninsured Americans aware that they need health care insurance. By this time next year; the Republican/Tea Party will be trying to take credit for the success of the program. All of those right wing talk show hosts and Congressional members who complain daily and tried to defund or repeal the Affordable Care Act, 2010 "ObamaCare" forty-eight (48) times have excellent health care insurance coverage (and some are subsidized by taxpayers) for themselves and their families. In 1936, when Franklin Roosevelt came up with Social Security, a Republican filibuster stopped FDR from funding the offices and personnel he needed to implement it. In addition to that, Alf Landon, the Republican candidate for president said, \u2018My first act of office will be to abolish Social Security.\u2019 "All the really great programs in American history was done without Republicans. Medicare in 1965 was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board."'

I believe that\'s what it\'s called when you pack up and go home, when a war fought under your own "civilized" terms is unwinnable."\n\u25fe"And if the liberal media and political community cannot accept that sometimes the wrong people get killed in war, then I can only suggest they first grow up and then serve a short stint up in the Hindu Kush. They probably would not survive."\n\u25fe"[Letting the goat herders go] was the stupidest, most southern-fried, lamebrained decision I ever made in my life. I must have been out of my mind. I had actually cast a vote which I knew could sign our death warrant. I\'d turned into a f@@cking liberal, a half-assed, no-logic nitwit, all heart, no brain, and the judgment of a jackrabbit."  So make sure you read the book...Hollywood does not tell the real story.   Gee...isn\'t his the same half azz logic LBJ\'s boys used in Viet Nam???   If you read the book you would know letting the goat herders go compromised the mission and Marcus\'s three buddies died because of it.  16 more died trying to rescue Marcus.  Bleeding heart liberals...'

Around 14,000 policies were cancelled every single month before the ACA, sometimes while the patient was in the hospital getting treatment. Now at least if you are cancelled you can still get insurance, even if you have a preexisting condition.    That kind of behavior by the insurance companies is exactly why we needed reform.'

I'm waiting for a letter from the new insurance company - but with Obama's plan I would be on a much better health plan and be saving nearly TWO HUNDRED a month. (Before Obamacare I tried to switch to another health insurance company and I was denied because of my health problems.) I can't live without the medications I take. I have a steady job. I pay my taxes. For those who think Obamacare is useless/etc - maybe you should stop thinking of yourselves and try to think of the other people out there who need help. There are people like me who work their butts off but can't afford $150+ every time they go to the pharmacy (and that's WITH insurance.) Stop thinking about yourselves and try - for a moment, if you can - to think about the other human beings you share this country with. Stop being so freaking selfish for a change."

Congress is going to allow all the illegals to collect on theirs! If you are young, just have plenty of babies. If you don't want to denounce your citizenship.,just start using a SSN that is NOT your own. You don't need one to get employment. Once you are hired just make one up! You can sue your employer if they fire you for this. You can develop a credit report with a fake SSN. Then go work some where else using a different SSN. Make sure you do a change of address and new phone number. Goodness don't pay back those high interest credit cards. I am writing a book on how to beat the system!  You can even avoid child support garnishment! When 2 illegal Hispanics used their names but my husband's SSN they taught me how to screw everyone and guess what! The federal government doesn't care! Google Robert Guenterberg. By the way, when you retire just walk into your local SSA office and show your real SSN card. The SSA will take everything out of their Social Security Suspense Earning file and you can collect your retirement."

message:	"I went to the exchange. Took nine days to get through the website. And I can't cover my children. It put my children on peach care. So no its not saving money. It's lowering the amount of people I'm covering on my policy. So we all are covering our children. The lady at the exchange told me that the states are overwhelmed with the amount of people that it is putting on medicaid. So it is not cheaper. It is converting the cost from you the individual to you the taxpayer. You are still paying for it."

I\'ll be honest, there needs to be some fixes, but this is a great foundation to build on. \n\nPeople fear the unknown and hate the dishonest "facts" fed to them by opponents. The common denominator is an un/misinformed person. Some media rely on this. The Obama Administration carries much of this blame due to their terrible rollout.'

I am being sent to a clinic and pay their price for doctors plus meds. Just for one that I needed on Monday, I spent 40 dls. And it was a generic. I have written to you, like now, many times. No one pays attention to the "gray" people like me. The ones that don\'t fit: 63 year olds, not making enough and not getting Medicare or Medicaid...I have an application number.

message:	"Thank you Mr. President.  Funny how people want to complain and blame health care cost on the president and not on the big insurance companies.  Or take responsibility for having health insurance for themselves.  But when they are hurt or sick, it's the tax payers that have to pay for their medical bills! SMH."

I'm waiting for a letter from the new insurance company - but with Obama's plan I would be on a much better health plan and be saving nearly TWO HUNDRED a month. (Before Obamacare I tried to switch to another health insurance company and I was denied because of my health problems.) I can't live without the medications I take. I have a steady job. I pay my taxes. For those who think Obamacare is useless/etc - maybe you should stop thinking of yourselves and try to think of the other people out there who need help. There are people like me who work their butts off but can't afford $150+ every time they go to the pharmacy (and that's WITH insurance.) Stop thinking about yourselves and try - for a moment, if you can - to think about the other human beings you share this country with. Stop being so freaking selfish for a change."

message:	"Denounce your citizenship. .do you think you would be deported? ??LOL!  Just how could the US handle it if we all became illegally here? If you have paid into social security don't worry. Congress is going to allow all the illegals to collect on theirs! If you are young, just have plenty of babies. If you don't want to denounce your citizenship.,just start using a SSN that is NOT your own. You don't need one to get employment. Once you are hired just make one up! You can sue your employer if they fire you for this. You can develop a credit report with a fake SSN. Then go work some where else using a different SSN. Make sure you do a change of address and new phone number. Goodness don't pay back those high interest credit cards. I am writing a book on how to beat the system!  You can even avoid child support garnishment! When 2 illegal Hispanics used their names but my husband's SSN they taught me how to screw everyone and guess what! The federal government doesn't care! Google Robert Guenterberg. By the way, when you retire just walk into your local SSA office and show your real SSN card. The SSA will take everything out of their Social Security Suspense Earning file and you can collect your retirement."

Thank the wealthy that  they have the right to trade our health on the stock market like we are sick and dying cattle. Also if you don't believe in health care for all citizens.

message:	'To whoever has a chance to read my messages\n\nThis is my perspective point of view only. It is not intend to be on any side except for my beloved King of Thailand.\n\nI am writing to you all about the problems that have been long term issues in Thailand, the land of smile, sincereness, and kindness country. The problem where people are fighting for their right to make Thailand change to be a better country for our children who will grow up to be adults who are responsible for our country.\n\nI believe in Thailand have occurs to be separate in four groups. One is group of people who support a better future politic. People who are stepping out to fight for all of us. To fight, hope, pray and believe for a better quality, fairness, and sincereness new pry minister. People who love our King so much and would like to fight for our future country for a better place to live for our children.\nSecond group is the group of people who are standing up for the ex-pry minister names Taksin Chinnawat. We believe those group of people who care to be on his side are manageable, controllable by the power of his billionaire money . Some who fight for him have a believe in term of think that if i support him, he will be the one to help me make more money because Taksin is a business man. He knows how to be a good business, but he failed to be a great pry minister at that time. We elected him to be a pry minister of Thailand in term of hoping he will be the one. The one who did not corrupt our money since he had been so rich already.The one who we believe to work hard to improve Thailand for a more civilized country. He was using our trust to destroy our country for his own good sake. He used his power to create a system called Taksin system where everywhere he went, everything he did were just to make him richer and richer. Some of people who joined his group had been tighten by money and business only. Some people who support him are people from countryside or people who accept his money to come fight for his power.\nThe third group is the group of people who do not care anything about our country. Not only that they enjoy making the situation get worse. They has not been standing up on any side , but for themselves.\nThe last group is the group who does not standing up on any side and tend to be does not care about anything either they have busy lives making more money or busy lives taking care their own business. What they do only upset about all the fights that occur in Thailand.\nAbout the protests that have been occurring in Thailand. For me, I am standing up for my King and Queen. I am standing up for a better future country for our children who will become quality adult in the future. I am standing up to destroy Taksin Chinnawat system who had have his sister Yinglak, pry minister of Thailand to be his own doll who he had been controlling behind the scene. I hope and pray for all of you, Thai Citizen who spend your valuable time to fight for me and for all of us. I am standing up for a true democracy in Thailand, not Communist.\nI am hoping and praying for one day, we will have a better Pry Minister who really care about Thai citizen more than himself. The Pry Minister who is a hard working, sincere, kind and care enough for all of us. The Pry Minister who is not care to make more money by his power for his own good sake. The chosen one who cares about our poor people.\nThere are ton of people who live on the street with no foods, clothes, nothing.\nPry Minister who sincerely love our Thai people just like how our king love his citizen.\nOur King Bhumibol Adulyadej has been working so hard all his life for his citizen. He work for no money. He cares for his citizen unconditionally.\nHe works so hard to improve our country for a more civilized place for all of his citizen. He had done many projects to help so many farmers in Thailand have a better lives. He has taught them many ways to improve a better quality and efficiency farms and products, so they can have a better lives. What he has done to all of us are not something that I can write here and finish it in one day. There are no words to describe enough how wonderful king he is. All I know is I love and respect my King very much from the bottom of my heart. I will do every way to make him happy. I will support whoever stand up on our king side. I will do every way I can to fight to whoever try to make my King unhappy.\n\nThis is a message from me Jutinut Suwanpathumlerd to Yinklak Chinawat and his brother Taksin Chinnawat.\n\nGO TO HELL\n\nYou are not belong to Thailand. You do not deserve to stand on the land where our King has work so hard for his citizen.\n\nOur country is not a country for your business, good sake and selfish.\n\nAgain just one writing will not be enough to describe how bad they are.\n\nYinkluck, go to hell. You do not deserve to have a power in Thailand if you can not use your power in a way for others, not for herself and her family. You guys are rich enough!!!\n\nGet out and go to hell. You and your stupid sister are not Thai citizen. You are not belong to Thailand.\n\nI apologize if my writing here would hurt anyone feeling.\nI apologize for my poor english skills if i made any mistake here.\n\nI do not apologize to Taksin, Yinklak and their supports group.'

message:	"The insurance companies are not going to go broke.  They would be insane to deny people treatment. They did not discontinue policies because they couldn't afford to comply with the ACA. Here's why :The insurance companies are allowed to make no more than 20% profit now because of the law. It does not matter how much prices go up or down, they will not make more or be forced to take less.  If the they choose to insure more people , they will make 20% on more policies.  They make 20% on the crappy policies, and they make 20% on the Cadillac policies.  So it wasn't exactly the cost increase for them to provide better insurance that caused them to drop people. It is more about hoping people will get rid of their lowball insurance plans and go for a bigger one.  Now if people get more expensive insurance, they will get 20% of a larger amount.  If a person requires $100 for treatment, they will make $20.  If the person requires $10,000 treatment, they will make $2,000. The extra actual costs of the insurance will be passed along to the consumer.  No downside for the insurance companies at this point.  The lobbied FOR the ACA The upside to this is that it appears to be working.  Medical spending has ALWAYS increased, but this year it increased the least that it has in 50 years!"

I don\'t dislike capitalism but I really wish that it didn\'t divide and conquer like it does, meaning that corporations who believe in it should be less selfish and be more into dynamism.\n2 minutes ago\n"Poverty is the ill definition of a hell condition, lack of prosperity and fortune and the money we spend on war should go to those who are living in it. if only money didn\'t overrule our democracy pro-capitalistically like international federal reserve banking systems, we\'d all be rich. forget corporations overhauling people who work minimum wage, why don\'t you don\'t deliver the solution, instead of using government interference to block applicability from reaching it\'s maximum. defense spending is useless, just like pumping billions into the economy considering the fact, that quantitative easing should never be used again because it undermines the debt, consumer price index with the value of economic recuperation and what the currency creates".'

Young people, believe me, you will someday need health insurance (break a leg, get a bad flu, need glasses, etc.).  You don't wait until you get into a car accident to buy car insurance, so why wait until you get sick to get health insurance.  Or .... is your car more important than your health?"

message:	"What has Obamacare done that is so wonderful?  85% of Americans were perfectly happy with their health insurance.  A 5 page bill could have taken care of the rest, but Obamacare was never about healthcare.  It's always been a data mining ponzi scheme, designed to redistribute the wealth. I heard on the radio today liberals crowing about Canadian healthcare. 2 problems with comparing us to Canada. 1-the sick in Canada aren't crowing about their healthcare.  Wait times to see specialists is 2 to 3 times longer than in the US. 2- Although Canada is a large country land wise, its population is less than California. I'm guessing it's a little easier to manage the healthcare needs on a state level than this one size fits few, national monstrosity."

According to one of the Libyan security guards who was stationed at one of the gates armed with only a radio, the assault began simultaneously from three directions.\n\nHeavy machine guns and rocket -propelled grenades were used, according to the guard. He said masked men threatened to kill him at gunpoint for 'protecting the infidels. He declined to appear on camera for fear of repercussions."

The sad thing about it is he knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in that country.  Did nothing to end that war. President Obama ended that war. Obama won the election fair and square.

message:	u'Dreamin, Embassy attacks?  Bush and Clinton both suffered it BUT...the answer is actually pretty simple: yeah, there were x-number of embassy attacks under Bush and they did not require investigations. For that matter there were all of these attacks on embassies and American interests under President Clinton, and they didn\u2019t require investigations, either.  Why not? Well, because under Bush the embassy attacks were taking place mostly in Iraq, and during a time of acknowledged war \u2014 right in the thick of it, in fact \u2014 and no one tried to argue that they were anything but planned and executed attacks.   And during the Clinton years, the attacks \u2014 which took place an average of every 18 months \u2014 were recognized as planned, organized attacks and no one tried to argue that they were anything different, either.  And while our embassies were attacked under these presidents, and others, none of our Ambassadors were murdered (along with Navy Seals) while multiple stand-down orders were given against mounting a rescue.  Neither the Bush nor Clinton administrations sought to mischaracterize the attacks on their embassies. Neither of them disseminated weirdly vague stories that was \u201creally\u201d took place was a spontaneous protest over an unseen, stupid video. And it was not the Bush (or Clinton) administration that \u2014 even after acknowledging a terror attack had occurred \u2014 repeated those lies to grieving parents or (weeks later) in a speech to the UN where the \u201cvideo\u201d was blamed six times.   See there is a difference, Bush, Clinton even Reagan had these issues BUT...Benghazi...well read it for yourself.'

message:	u'After the Affordable Care Act, 2010 "ObamaCare" is fully implemented with the new state exchanges and fine-tuned; it will join the ranks of Social Security and Medicare as the three best anti-poverty programs ever enacted into law in the country. Health care account for 18% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Medical bills are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. There are 48.6 million uninsured Americans according to the 2012 census, and 37% of all uninsured Americans have household incomes above $50,000. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States spent more on health care per capita ($8,608), and more on health care as percentage of its GDP than any other nation in 2012. The Commonwealth Fund ranked the United States last in the quality of health care among similar countries, and notes U.S. care costs the most. In a 2013 ranking of nations with the most efficient health care systems, the United States ranks 46th among the 48 countries included in the study. Recent evidence demonstrates that lack of health insurance causes some 45,000 to 48,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States. In 2007, 62.1% of filers for bankruptcies claimed high medical expenses. A 2013 study found that about 25% of all senior citizens declare bankruptcy due to medical expenses, and 43% are forced to mortgage or sell their primary residence. In some states, over a quarter of the population is uninsured, including 6 million in Texas. In addition to having the highest rate of people without health insurance in the nation, Texas also has the largest number of children without health insurance and the highest rate of poor adults without health insurance, according to 2012 American Community Survey estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2012. So; would you prefer people use the emergency room for their primary health care and the most expensive with the least wellness outcome; or do you want affordable health care for all that would bend the cost curve and force people to take some personal responsibility for their health care? Where is the Republican/Tea Party alternative health care plan that would keep Americans out of the emergency room? \nkeep in mind that \'taxpayers\' subsidize the uninsured by an average $1,100 in federal taxes every year. Hospitals absorb some of the costs which lead to high rates for patients, and higher premium costs for private insurance policies. Private health care insurance will continue to exist in the country, although policies were often substandard before the Affordable Care Act, 2010...and the most expensive in the world. One key in reaching the goal of universal coverage is making uninsured Americans aware that they need health care insurance. By this time next year; the Republican/Tea Party will be trying to take credit for the success of the program. All of those right wing talk show hosts and Congressional members who complain daily and tried to defund or repeal the Affordable Care Act, 2010 "ObamaCare" forty-eight (48) times have excellent health care insurance coverage (and some are subsidized by taxpayers) for themselves and their families. In 1936, when Franklin Roosevelt came up with Social Security, a Republican filibuster stopped FDR from funding the offices and personnel he needed to implement it. In addition to that, Alf Landon, the Republican candidate for president said, \u2018My first act of office will be to abolish Social Security.\u2019 "All the really great programs in American history was done without Republicans. Medicare in 1965 was done without Republican support until the last vote where they realized they had to get on board."'

Tudo motivado pelas mortes que l\xe1 foram proporcionados pelos delinquentes que ali est\xe3o condenados a pena. Os maranhenses estavam quase que detidos pelas for\xe7as existente da pol\xedtica de oposi\xe7\xe3o ao governo do Estado. Tudo numa deprava\xe7\xe3o de aceitamento de aproveitamentos de consequ\xeancias geradas por falta de assist\xeancia aos pres\xeddios e aos fieis moradores daquelas existentes resid\xeancias dos pobres coitados que ali est\xe3o na sua complexidade de viver bem. Quem sabe at\xe9 melhor do que as vitimas que lhes foram feitas atrav\xe9s das a\xe7\xf5es criminosas que as comentaram contra as pessoas de bens.\n          Vieram pra c\xe1 o governo Federal, Direitos humanos e os cambaos pra que pudessem dar melhor assist\xeancia ao Complexo Penitenci\xe1rio de Pedrinhas ou mesmo ter as largadas pra constru\xe7\xe3o de novos pres\xeddios pra conforma aqueles coitados delinquentes. Ai vem por tr\xe1s dos acontecimentos os aproveitamentos pol\xedticos, aqueles que se colocam no obscuro e passam por um santo de pau oco. E ais passam por serem os apoiadores da melhora de tudo que \xe9 preciso, e ainda por cima de tudo vai levando pra outro lado da pol\xedtica pensando que os maranhenses s\xe3o incapazes de nota os erros dos precipitados oposicionistas que torcem por um Maranh\xe3o mais atrasado. Quem n\xe3o esta vendo o crescimento do Estado, quem n\xe3o esta vendo cidades sendo asfaltadas e sendo interligadas com as BRs que fazem parte do desenvolvimento rural e urbano daqueles munic\xedpios que viviam no isolamento da sua estrada asfaltada pra o escoamento de sua produ\xe7\xe3o.\n            O avan\xe7o esta a olho nu visto por todos, ent\xe3o porque esses ataques contundentes, que deixam a consci\xeancia maranhense descontentes com a oposi\xe7\xe3o com seu posicionamento pol\xedtico. Porque n\xe3o procurar de forma coerente trabalhar em vez de atrapalhar, e dentro do contexto pol\xedtico evidenciar seus projetos e com essa a\xe7\xe3o deixar com que o governo fa\xe7a o seu trabalho como esta a fazer. Constru\xe7\xe3o de Upas, de Hospitais, de col\xe9gios, de estradas e de melhoramento at\xe9 da Ponta da Madeira, pra aqueles que v\xe3o viaja de ferry boaty terem melhor conforto na espera de sua viajem no atravessa do mar, pra irem a Baixada Maranhense.\n              A tortura pol\xedtica que fizeram contra o governo atual esta revestida de p\xe9ssimas imagens da oposi\xe7\xe3o aos maranhenses, tudo foi como uma boia que vez de ficar acima do mar turbulento da pol\xedtica, ficou cheia de \xe1guas podre e depois veio a estoura ao contrario de quem deveria ser estourado. Quem recebeu toda sua estou ra\xe7\xe3o foi \xe0 oposi\xe7\xe3o que dentro deste epis\xf3dio esta a sair de forma in-complexa de dor sem resultado estrat\xe9gico na sua pr\xf3pria queda de rede.\n               Foram dias  atr\xe1s de dias que o governo do estado ficou fiscalizado e vigiado, e o seu governante totalmente desassossegado numa postura pol\xedtica de muitas reportagens a n\xedvel nacional.

Now at least if you are cancelled you can still get insurance, even if you have a preexisting condition.    That kind of behavior by the insurance companies is exactly why we needed reform.'

All 57 million people had a choice and made it and the righties hate it! They are the worst when they don't get their way! You guys lost twice in a row for a reason, get over it! My dad told me you must lose with as much grace as you win with! Just Vote and we will see what happens cause a sore loser will always be one! I respect your right to your opinion, too bad not everyone does!"

message:	u'This story originally appeared on Huffington Post and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nWikiLeaks published a leaked draft of the environment chapter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Wednesday, and environmental groups are lining up to take a swing.The leaked documents come from a meeting of the trade deal\'s chief negotiators held in Salt Lake City, Utah, from Nov. 19 to 24, 2013. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) includes 12 countries-the United States, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Chile, Singapore, Peru, Vietnam, New Zealand and Brunei-and would govern a number of international environmental and trade issuesThe draft indicates the pact will include a number of promises on the environment, but will lack strong enforcement tools. "When compared against other TPP chapters, the Environment Chapter is noteworthy for its absence of mandated clauses or meaningful enforcement measures," wrote WikiLeaks in its release. The chapter is intended to deal with issues like overfishing, trade of wood products, wildlife crime, and illegal logging. But most of the measures in the chapter are voluntary, rather than binding, and do not include penalties or criminal sanctions for violations. Compliance is largely left to the respective countries.\n\nEnviros offered similar criticism. "The lack of fully-enforceable environmental safeguards means negotiators are allowing a unique opportunity to protect wildlife and support legal sustainable trade of renewable resources to slip through their fingers," said Carter Roberts, president and CEO of the World Wildlife Fund, in a statement.The leaked document from November is only a draft, but if the trade pact\'s final environmental chapter looks like it, it would make the Obama administration\'s environmental trade record "worse than George W. Bush\'s," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. "This draft chapter falls flat on every single one of our issues\u2013oceans, fish, wildlife, and forest protections\u2013and in fact, rolls back on the progress made in past free trade pacts."According to a report from the chairs of the TPP Environmental Working Group drafting the chapter, also released by WikiLeaks, there remains significant disagreement among the parties on many of the pact\'s provisions. The chairs wrote that Vietnam, Peru and Malaysia object to a provision calling for countries to "rationalize and phase out" fossil fuel subsidies "that encourage wasteful consumption." They also noted that the United States and Australia object to the climate change portion of the pact as it is written.Negotiation of the pact has been underway since 2010, but all discussions take place entirely outside of public view. The Obama administration has already received backlash for leaked portions of the pact that indicate it would grant greater rights to corporations to challenge national laws in private courts.\n\nEfforts to fast-track the trade deal met resistance from Democrats in Congress this week.\n\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative did not respond to a request for comment on the documents.'

Found a plan with $1000 deductible and $1500 more out of pocket and low or no co pays for routine care & screening - for about $100 less than I've been paying.  Healthcare.gov allowed me to easily shop the marketplace and get the new policy - easily.  If companies have been raising their rates to ridiculous levels, blame your state insurance departments who are approving those rates.  BTW, I have twice gotten refunds of premiums because of the 80/20 rule - at least something to assure companies are spending dollars on healthcare."

message:	'..\n\nOBAMACARE ENROLLEMENT EXPLODED IN DECEMBER TO 2.2 MILLION:\n\n"The December enrollment surge for the Affordable Care Act that the Obama administration long predicted -- and desperately needed -- has come to fruition".\n\n"As of Dec. 28, 2.2 million Americans have enrolled in private health coverage, according to new data released Monday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. More than 1.8 million of them signed up in December alone, a huge spike that has gotten the law closer to its original goals than most would have thought possible after HealthCare.gov\'s disastrous rollout in October"\n\nRepublicans have had nearly 4 years at this point to come up with an alternative to Obamacare. If they were serious about reforming America\'s pathetic healthcare system, and there was such an obviously better alternative that they had (that they were willing to enact), then they would have crafted it and passed it in the House already, and they would have been pressuring the Senate and Obama to enact it.\n\nThe fact that they STILL have nothing betrays every single point they\'ve made against Obamacare, or about American health care in general since Obama took office.\n\nhttp://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/obamacare-december-enrollment-numbers'

message:	u'Fired Inspector General for discovering that Obama\u2019s friend had embezzled government funds\n\nIn June 2009, Obama fired Inspector General Gerald Walpin, after Walpin accused Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson, an Obama supporter, of misuse of AmeriCorps funding to pay for school-board political activities. In a letter to Congress, the White House said that Walpin was fired because he was \u201cconfused, disoriented, unable to answer questions and exhibited other behavior that led the Board to question his capacity to serve.\u201d A bipartisan group of 145 current and former public officials, attorneys, and legal scholars signed a letter that was sent to the White House, which defended Walpin, said the criticisms of him were not true, and said that his firing was politically motivated.'

message:	"Excellent analysis by economist Garrett Baldwin, Johns Hopkins University:\n\nHappy New Year from the U.S. government. Now, empty your pockets. We have to give your money to someone else.\nOn Jan. 1, the Affordable Care Act's coverage law went into effect, requiring a slew of new Obamacare taxes, fines, and fees to finance hundreds of billions in costs the government requires to operate the program. \nWelcome to the Dark Side of the Affordable Care Act, the part where we actually have to pay for all those great benefits we've been hearing about for more than three years.\nIt drives up premiums, redistributes middle-class wealth to the uninsured, and fails to achieve what should have been the primary goal of healthcare reform: Better, more affordable care for everyone."

Being sick is one thing, but being lazy is another. just another entitlement program. get off your butts and go to work and stop taking from the ones who work their butts off to have what they have. if you want to share the wealth president get your check book out and start writing checks out to those free loaders."

If you\'re in the throes of a heart attack, treatment will commence after a full credit check is done. Of course since your medical condition makes you a high credit risk, you also won\'t mind a 27.9% interest rate on that 6-figure note. \nAfter all, if supermarkets, department stores, clothiers, and car dealers have a right to get paid before you get their product or service, health care providers should have the same right. And if you can\'t afford a Mercedes, you don\'t get to buy one. So, if you can\'t afford a visit to the ER when you have your MI, you don\'t get that ER visit.'

We all know that happy patients usually don't complete surveys but of course the angry or unhappy ones will fill out a negative survey every single time. How can we be sure to get accurate reflection of patient satisfaction if surveys are voluntary?? If they're gonna be paid in part based on patient satisfaction then it would make sense that surveys are mandatory to be completed by patients for every visit."

I say blame the companies that have sold us out for Profit. Blame the ones that have put pure profit and their own bias ways to more or less self destroy this nation .And those they have made fortunes of the trading of stocks as the conceal their employers health care.. For you see when we allowed this thought of free trade we did not realize it would lead to the wealthiest selling our country out for a penny's off the bloody backs of the working class,.. \n At what point do we understand that's it not correct for people to Die because as a country we don't care ..Do you need to loose your house, thrown into a debt you will never get out of ,be refused health care .. As the family that you care about dies by lack of care ..Are we that shallow that we can only understand care when the plague is at our door ..If that's what it takes then we are truly a lost society .. I believe in life over profit , iam also a Christian and by what I have read and comprehended that means life over all profit or material objects.. And I hope before a pre-Existing condition of profit takes you and your loved ones.."

Doctors offices are getting a base minimum per patient, and refusing to service the ahca and in the end no one is being helped.  This was supposed to be affordable and accessible health care coverage and a revolutionary opportunity.  Not to mention the loophole for employers who dont want to offer hc by cutting hrs under 30hrs.  Wheres the waiver for people from penalty that cant pay 600 a month who work part time and dont make enough to pay bills let alone for hc.  It was not supposed to be billed on a curve but at incredible discounts.   People have been patient with the phones and website, spend hrs signing up to no success.  Im eager to hear how this can improve immediately.  I suggest that reasonable letters be written to our representatives.  Its ok that its not perfect but lets not waste time and fix it.  This is an intelligent country and theres no reason we cant amend.  Its not political and i dont care to hear anyone subjecting our Pres. With negative comments.   Alot of people work in our government and are in positions to whom we can reach out.  Lets now take part in this team and see what can improve.  For some with ins.

message:	u'The Big Story that the Media Deliberately Missed\nPosted on Thursday, January 16, 2014 at 02:00PM\n\nThe media always misses the big stories of historic proportion. Only years later do they reluctantly admit it.\n\nHere are some examples of globally-significant stories that the anti-Christian mainstream media deliberately lost in the shuffle. The stories have to do with events in Egypt during the last few years\u2014events that I am very familiar with.\n\nIt is impossible to ascertain whether they refuse to report these stories because of their anti-Christian bias, or because the stories run contrary to the narrative propagated by the current White House. Either way, the omissions are no accident.\n\nThe Egyptian Revolution of January 2011 was fully covered\u2014every media outlet had reporters on the ground in Tahrir Square. It was a story that executive producers in New York and London could embrace with gusto: Masses of people demonstrating against a secular dictator.\n\nThe White House believed that Mubarak should be replaced by an Islamist, and the media fell right in line. The State Department had long felt that an Islamist government was inevitable, so they might as well support it now by supporting the uprising. Even the European Union, to pacify its burgeoning Islamist population, got on the bandwagon.\n\nBut we all know the results now:\n\n    The Obama Administration got its wish and Mubarak resigned.\n    An Islamist, Mohamed Morsi, ran for president, even though he was in prison at the time of the revolution and illegally broke out.\n    Through a series of campaign lies, Morsi was elected, despite only receiving 11 million votes out of a population of 90 million.\n    The Muslim Brotherhood members who advised President Obama propagated a message of \u201cdemocracy in our time\u201d to the Western media.\n    The media ran with the story: \u201cThe First Democratically Elected President in Egyptian History.\u201d That sounded good to the uninformed. \n\nThen soon after Morsi get into office, he declared himself a dictator and above the law. Did we hear even the softest grumble of opposition from the White House or other Western capitals? No, not a word.\n\nWithin twelve months of Morsi\u2019s reign, Egypt was brought to its knees economically, socially, and politically. A result far more disastrous than anything its secular predecessor could have possibly accomplished.\n\nBut the media covered up that disaster. Why? It didn\u2019t fit the narrative. The White House and its aligned media executives believed Islamists would be good for Egypt and good for the Middle East.\n\nThen came June 30, 2013, when more than 30 million people, from all walks of life and religious persuasions, angrily demanded new elections. But dictators, especially Islamist dictators (as we have seen with Hamas), detest re-elections.\n\nThus when the army acted as steward of stability and stood by the protesters (the size of the mass protests were unprecedented in human history), the White House condemned the army\u2019s action as a military coup. In order to punish Egypt, Obama took the law into his own hands and cut aid to Egypt\u2014aid that was agreed to back at the 1978 Camp David Accords.\n\nBut there\u2019s even another big story that the media missed.\n\nDuring the twelve months of the Islamist dictatorship, the Christian minority, which numbers between 10 and 17 million, were openly persecuted. Throughout the Islamist reign, they went to their churches in enormous numbers, packing them for prayer meetings. Some of those prayer meetings witnessed thousands upon thousands of people praying 24/7\u2014crying out to God to hear their pleas.\n\nEven many non-Christians believe that the demise of the Muslim Brotherhood government came as a direct answer to the prayers of those believers. But try explaining that to the BBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, or CNN.\n\nOf course, the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood punished the Christians by burning many of their churches, homes, and businesses. Yet the Christians saw that as a small price to pay for a better future for their country.\n\nBut here\u2019s the biggest story that the media kept locked away:\n\nDuring the recent Christmas and New Year celebrations in Egypt, the interim president, Adly Mansour, went to the Coptic Cathedral. There, he met and embraced the patriarch and expressed the good wishes of all Egyptians for Christmas and the New Year.\n\nThat had never happened before in the past 1,400 years of majority-Islamic rule.\n\nThat meeting was of great significance, not only for Egypt or the region, but for all Muslims who are truly moderates. It was a gesture that can help to ultimately fulfill the dreams of all peace-loving people.\n\nBut the media deliberately ignored that possible world-impacting and future-altering event.\n\nWill those who control most of the dissemination of news in the West ever turn back to the honest and transparent reporting of such history-making events? Unfortunately, I doubt it.'

Then the drone thing not being allowed to shift from CIA to Pentagon snuck into the budget this week. Nothing seems right.  Not even close.  Honestly, I feel duped, really and sad as I feel like I have to stop defending you.  Thanks for the attempt at health care.  I wished it had all gone better.   I'm not really going to support anyone in politics anymore.  This was sort of my last 'hurrah'.  I don't suppose it's your fault.  I don't know.  Maybe it's all a ruse.  Anyway, there are no Frank Capra miracles after all.  God bless."

You may be loud, but you are a tiny little minority.  Did you know that over 70% percent of the people don't want to see the ACA repealed?  They want to see it improved.  You guys are the lunatic fringe.  If you think you are helping to fight some noble cause, you are wrong.  When decent people read your hateful posts, they are repelled.

message:	'"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America\'s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.  It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills.  It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government\'s reckless fiscal policies.  Increasing America\'s debt weakens us domestically and internationally.  Leadership means that, \'the buck stops here.\'  Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.  America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership.  Americans deserve better."    ~ Senator Barack H.  Obama, March 2006'

I\'m neither Dem nor Rep, but this petty "us vs. them" bickering has to stop if we ever want to get our nation on a better track.  This blaming of Bush for Obama\'s mistakes is pathetic, especially - 8 years of one bad President does not mean we need another 8 years of another bad President.  And Republicans, think about why you\'re so angry now, and so quick to hate him and give him zero credit; the man might be a con man, or he might just be naive... hell, his plans might actually even work.  Now, I\'m with the economists who flat out say it won\'t, as I put my faith in mathematics, but that\'s the thing - this isn\'t an issue of "Red vs. Blue", this is an issue of doing what we think is best for the nation in all ways.  And I repeat "in all ways" - bankrupting future generations so that we can have 10 years of healthcare is not worth it in the long run, and is ultimately terrible for our nation.  Think about the future.  I find many Progressives care about the environment and the future of the planet, but fail to think about the future of the nation and economy - a child is just as likely to die from hunger from poverty as he or she is from poison air from pollution.\n\nOk, rant over, I\'m now ready to be called a "commy faget" and "republiCON faux news bible thumper" :P'

message:	"Tina 600$ a month is amazingly affordable for us! It's good to know that, if for some reason our income dropped, we would be eligible for subsidies.  A few days ago, I was telling people how , about 5 years ago, I was forced to make  a really hard decision.  I had cancer and had insurance at the time.  It wasn't great insurance, but it paid for some of the surgery.  Then, since I couldn't get the chemo/radiation therapy without going 350 miles from my home for a month and a half, I was forced to decide between my treatment and insurance.  It would have cost me 2000$ a month to keep my insurance, and I had to leave my job.  I chose to live.  I paid for the treatments out of pocket. I didn't go bankrupt like a lot of people do, but I was financially devastated.  I lived in fear that my cancer might come back, and this time I simply couldn't afford treatment.  Now, for the first time since I had to drop my insurance, I am covered.  Not only am I covered, I was covered for less than I have been paying every month for medications that I can now get for a modest co-pay.  I have been able to quit my job and am giving respite care to a family member with an autistic child.  ( and don't worry, I'm still not getting a subsidy)."

First, I don't know how they can call them courts since they are one sided and no one knows what happens in them. Secret courts are a really bad idea. To the extent something needs to be kept from the public (and it should be extremely rare), a routine court can close the doors and go into a closed session. But...at some point - whether it be in one month or 5 years - the minutes from that closed hearing should be released. Even the most secret matters at the moment at some point in time become non urgent, and simply history - and a chance for us to police our government (even if it is looking back at time.) Keeping matters secret should not be routine -- and in DC, it is. There are so many documents that the government (and this has been going on for decades) stamps classified that should not be. I think classified is an easy way for the government to hide things from you. Sure, some things should be classified, but not all...and there does come a time when even a classified document is no longer national security. Perfect example? The August 12, 2013 cable from Benghazi consulate to the State Department. There is no reason to keep that cable under wraps - it should be declassified (and if there is one thing in it that should be classified, just redact that part until a future date...but the whole document should not be kept under wraps with a classified document stamp. Our government needs to be reminded from time to time, that we are an open nation, and that the government employees work for us and not the other way around. Yes, some matters should be classified and secret...but certainly not as much as they have been doing. And..to get back to the secret courts, that's a bad idea. It is one sided..and you never get to hear what is argued or decided...and you sure don't have anyone advocating for you there.\n\nLike \xb7  \xb7 Share \xb7 2,488257510 \xb7 10 hours ago \xb7"

Since millions are dropped every year around Jan 1st, this isn't anything new.  In fact this level of fuckery by the insurance companies is a good reason we need the protection the ACA provides.

That had nothing to do with the republicans, they are constantly fighting about this! Will you please tell me exactly what Obama is responsible for? He knows nothing about anything, an he is not responsible for nothing! Everything that has happened under his watch is someone else's fault..... That's complete BS!!!!

message:	'"My party is full of racists.\n\nOct 2012\n\nThe Republican Party is full of Racists\n\n"Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, a self-identified Republican who was Gen. Colin Powell\'s chief of staff during his time as secretary of state, did not take too kindly to a recent accusation -- from Mitt Romney\'s controversial campaign co-chair John Sununu -- that Powell only endorsed Barack Obama for president because they\'re both black. Sununu would later backtrack, but the damage was done.\n\nWilkerson, who is white, didn\'t mince words on MSNBC\'sThe Ed Show Friday night. "To say that Colin Powell would endorse President Obama because of his skin color is like saying Mother Teresa worked for profit," he said. And although he gave Sununu a bit of a pass, blaming his statement on an "unfortunate" choice of words, Wilkerson had much harsher words for the GOP as a whole.\n\n"Let me just be candid," he said. "My party is full of racists. And the real reason a considerable portion of my party wants President Obama out of the White House has nothing to do with the content of his character, nothing to do with his competence as commander in chief and president, and everything to do with the color of his skin. And that\'s despicable." from the Root webpage http://www.theroot.com/buzz/former-powell-chief-st'

message:	u'Accomplishments by the Obama Administration...1. Passed Health Care Reform: After five presidents over a century failed to create universal health insurance, signed the Affordable Care Act (2010). It will cover 32 million uninsured Americans beginning in 2014 and mandates a suite of experimental measures to cut health care cost growth, the number one cause of America\u2019s long-term fiscal problems.\n\n2. Passed the Stimulus: Signed $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 to spur economic growth amid greatest recession since the Great Depression. Weeks after stimulus went into effect, unemployment claims began to subside. Twelve months later, the private sector began producing more jobs than it was losing, and it has continued to do so for twenty-three straight months, creating a total of nearly 3.7 million new private-sector jobs.\n\n3. Passed Wall Street Reform: Signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010) to re-regulate the financial sector after its practices caused the Great Recession. The new law tightens capital requirements on large banks and other financial institutions, requires derivatives to be sold on clearinghouses and exchanges, mandates that large banks provide \u201cliving wills\u201d to avoid chaotic bankruptcies, limits their ability to trade with customers\u2019 money for their own profit, and creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (now headed by Richard Cordray) to crack down on abusive lending products and companies.\n\n4. Ended the War in Iraq: Ordered all U.S. military forces out of the country. Last troops left on December 18, 2011.'

message:	u'Obama did what? 11. Told Mubarak to Go: On February 1, 2011, publicly called on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to accept reform or step down, thus weakening the dictator\u2019s position and putting America on the right side of the Arab Spring. Mubarak ended thirty-year rule when overthrown on February 11.\n\n12. Reversed Bush Torture Policies: Two days after taking office, nullified Bush-era rulings that had allowed detainees in U.S. custody to undergo certain \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques considered inhumane under the Geneva Conventions. Also released the secret Bush legal rulings supporting the use of these techniques.\n\n13. Improved America\u2019s Image Abroad: With new policies, diplomacy, and rhetoric, reversed a sharp decline in world opinion toward the U.S. (and the corresponding loss of \u201csoft power\u201d) during the Bush years. From 2008 to 2011, favorable opinion toward the United States rose in ten of fifteen countries surveyed by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, with an average increase of 26 percent.\n\n14. Kicked Banks Out of Federal Student Loan Program, Expanded Pell Grant Spending: As part of the 2010 health care reform bill, signed measure ending the wasteful decades-old practice of subsidizing banks to provide college loans. Starting July 2010 all students began getting their federal student loans directly from the federal government. Treasury will save $67 billion over ten years, $36 billion of which will go to expanding Pell Grants to lower-income students.\n\n15. Created Race to the Top: With funds from stimulus, started $4.35 billion program of competitive grants to encourage and reward states for education reform.\n\n16. Boosted Fuel Efficiency Standards: Released new fuel efficiency standards in 2011 that will nearly double the fuel economy for cars and trucks by 2025.'

Passed Mini Stimuli: To help families hurt by the recession and spur the economy as stimulus spending declined, signed series of measures (July 22, 2010; December 17, 2010; December 23, 2011) to extend unemployment insurance and cut payroll taxes.\n\n19. Began Asia \u201cPivot\u201d: In 2011, reoriented American military and diplomatic priorities and focus from the Middle East and Europe to the Asian-Pacific region. Executed multipronged strategy of positively engaging China while reasserting U.S. leadership in the region by increasing American military presence and crafting new commercial, diplomatic, and military alliances with neighboring countries made uncomfortable by recent Chinese behavior.\n\n20. Increased Support for Veterans: With so many soldiers coming home from Iraq and Iran with serious physical and mental health problems, yet facing long waits for services, increased 2010 Department of Veterans Affairs budget by 16 percent and 2011 budget by 10 percent. Also signed new GI bill offering $78 billion in tuition assistance over a decade, and provided multiple tax credits to encourage businesses to hire veterans.\n\n21. Tightened Sanctions on Iran: In effort to deter Iran\u2019s nuclear program, signed Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act (2010) to punish firms and individuals who aid Iran\u2019s petroleum sector. In late 2011 and early 2012, coordinated with other major Western powers to impose sanctions aimed at Iran\u2019s banks and with Japan, South Korea, and China to shift their oil purchases away from Iran.'

Estimated cost to utilities: at least $11 billion by 2016. Estimated health benefits: $59 billion to $140 billion. Will also significantly reduce carbon emissions and, with other regulations, comprises what\u2019s been called Obama\u2019s \u201cstealth climate policy.\u201d\n\n23. Passed Credit Card Reforms: Signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (2009), which prohibits credit card companies from raising rates without advance notification, mandates a grace period on interest rate increases, and strictly limits overdraft and other fees.\n\n24. Eliminated Catch-22 in Pay Equality Laws: Signed Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009, giving women who are paid less than men for the same work the right to sue their employers after they find out about the discrimination, even if that discrimination happened years ago. Under previous law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the statute of limitations on such suits ran out 180 days after the alleged discrimination occurred, even if the victims never knew about it.\n\n25. Protected Two Liberal Seats on the U.S. Supreme Court: Nominated and obtained confirmation for Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic and third woman to serve, in 2009; and Elena Kagan, the fourth woman to serve, in 2010. They replaced David Souter and John Paul Stevens, respectively.'

Expanded National Service: Signed Serve America Act in 2009, which authorized a tripling of the size of AmeriCorps. Program grew 13 percent to 85,000 members across the country by 2012, when new House GOP majority refused to appropriate more funds for further expansion.\n\n29. Expanded Wilderness and Watershed Protection: Signed Omnibus Public Lands Management Act (2009), which designated more than 2 million acres as wilderness, created thousands of miles of recreational and historic trails, and protected more than 1,000 miles of rivers.\n\n30. Gave the FDA Power to Regulate Tobacco: Signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (2009). Nine years in the making and long resisted by the tobacco industry, the law mandates that tobacco manufacturers disclose all ingredients, obtain FDA approval for new tobacco products, and expand the size and prominence of cigarette warning labels, and bans the sale of misleadingly labeled \u201clight\u201d cigarette brands and tobacco sponsorship of entertainment events.\n\n31. Pushed Federal Agencies to Be Green Leaders: Issued executive order in 2009 requiring all federal agencies to make plans to soften their environmental impacts by 2020. Goals include 30 percent reduction in fleet gasoline use, 26 percent boost in water efficiency, and sustainability requirements for 95 percent of all federal contracts. Because federal government is the country\u2019s single biggest purchaser of goods and services, likely to have ripple effects throughout the economy for years to come.'

Began Post-Post-9/11 Military Builddown: After winning agreement from congressional Republicans and Democrats in summer 2011 budget deal to reduce projected defense spending by $450 billion, proposed new DoD budget this year with cuts of that size and a new national defense strategy that would shrink ground forces from 570,000 to 490,000 over the next ten years while increasing programs in intelligence gathering and cyberwarfare.\n\n35. Let Space Shuttle Die and Killed Planned Moon Mission: Allowed the expensive ($1 billion per launch), badly designed, dangerous shuttle program to make its final launch on July 8, 2011. Cut off funding for even more bloated and problem-plagued Bush-era Constellation program to build moon base in favor of support for private-sector low-earth orbit ventures, research on new rocket technologies for long-distance manned flight missions, and unmanned space exploration, including the largest interplanetary rover ever launched, which will investigate Mars\u2019s potential to support life.\n\n36. Invested Heavily in Renewable Technology: As part of the 2009 stimulus, invested $90 billion, more than any previous administration, in research on smart grids, energy efficiency, electric cars, renewable electricity generation, cleaner coal, and biofuels.'

message:	u'More Obama accomplishments.....38. Cracked Down on Bad For-Profit Colleges: In effort to fight predatory practices of some for-profit colleges, Department of Education issued \u201cgainful employment\u201d regulations in 2011 cutting off commercially focused schools from federal student aid funding if more than 35 percent of former students aren\u2019t paying off their loans and/or if the average former student spends more than 12 percent of his or her total earnings servicing student loans.\n\n39. Improved School Nutrition: In coordination with Michelle Obama, signed Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010 mandating $4.5 billion spending boost and higher nutritional and health standards for school lunches. New rules based on the law, released in January, double the amount of fruits and vegetables and require only whole grains in food served to students.\n\n40. Expanded Hate Crimes Protections: Signed Hate Crimes Prevention Act (2009), which expands existing hate crime protections to include crimes based on a victim\u2019s sexual orientation, gender, or disability, in addition to race, color, religion, or national origin.\n\n41. Avoided Scandal: As of November 2011, served longer than any president in decades without a scandal, as measured by the appearance of the word \u201cscandal\u201d (or lack thereof) on the front page of the Washington Post.\n\n42. Brokered Agreement for Speedy Compensation to Victims of Gulf Oil Spill: Though lacking statutory power to compel British Petroleum to act, used moral authority of his office to convince oil company to agree in 2010 to a $20 billion fund to compensate victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico; $6.5 billion already paid out without lawsuits. By comparison, it took nearly two decades for plaintiffs in the Exxon Valdez Alaska oil spill case to receive $1.3 billion.'

I am agree with you that it is a great campaign to support people to have a low cost affordable health care. What's about people who lost their jobs, and have no money or even bankruptcy??? Will they be able to have free health insurance? Even Medicare still have so many rules set up. My income was so low. I made less than $2000 a month. I had been trying to apply for a medicare before. I got approved. Look what I got. You can have medical, but you have to pay $2000 something to be able to use medical. Your income is not qualify for 0 pay. WOW! I was so impress of the system or whoever gave me the approve. How am I gonna be able to use my medical when the cost is greater than my income. If I am dying now, I still can't afford to pay for a doctor to help me. One time I got an accident. The police asked me, do you want to go to a doctor. YES, absolutely I would love to see a doctor. My head was injured, my chest was very hurt and pain, BUT what my answered are NO, I couldn't go to see a doctor because my insurance are not cover for the emergency car, moreover I cannot afford to pay for the deductible."

message:	"To Barack Obama,\n\nMy suggestion ideas of the solution to avoid unemployment for all of us. How about set up a training for a group of small enterprises and big enterprise in every cities.Provide full free training class for business owners to have more knowledge of how to make their business survive nowadays. Support loan for business owners who need help for their businesses. Work on discussion with all Bank ownerships, and asking for their supports. Extend loans for business ownerships. when they need supporting money, so they don't end up bankruptcy. Because of losing the company or can't handle to hire some employee, employees are end up losing their jobs. That problem leads to when people need unemployment benefits. The unemployment benefit which is never pay full and enough amount. It is never enough for a living. Giving an opportunity to provide a better loan with affordable interest rate."

message:	u'TROTZ WALL-STREET-HAUSSE\nUS-Wirtschaft droht b\xf6ses Erwachen\ngestern 08:27 \u2022 Finanzen100\nWegen des Gelddruckens der Fed entfernt sich der Aktienmarkt immer mehr von den fundamentalen Daten Wegen des Gelddruckens der Fed entfernt sich der Aktienmarkt immer mehr von den fundamentalen Daten\nWie jedes Jahr sagen Volkswirte auch f\xfcr 2014 eine deutliche Beschleunigung des Wachstums der US-Wirtschaft voraus. Das halten wir aber f\xfcr \xe4u\xdferst unwahrscheinlich, einfach weil die Verschuldung der Amerikaner so gro\xdf ist. Deswegen kann die Schuldensause im Gegensatz zu der Zeit vor der Finanzkrise nicht mehr auf Hochtouren laufen. Wir rechnen vielmehr mit einer deutlichen Konjunkturabschw\xe4chung. Kann das den Aktienmarkt bremsen, zumal die Fed ihr Anleihenkaufprogramm bis zum Jahresende auslaufen lassen will?\nnicht mit Facebook verbunden\nnicht mit Twitter verbunden\nnicht mit Google+ verbunden\nEinstellungen\n\nDer US-Aktienmarkt haussiert: Er steigt bei guten Konjunkturdaten ebenso wie bei schlechten. Bei guten Daten klettert der S&P500 deswegen, weil Investoren darauf setzen, dass die Wirtschaft stark genug ist, um die allm\xe4hliche Versch\xe4rfung der Geldpolitik verkraften zu k\xf6nnen. Bei schlechten Daten steigen die Aktien, weil Investoren darauf setzen, dass die Fed sich mehr Zeit lassen wird bei der Versch\xe4rfung der Geldpolitik.\nS&P 500 S&P 500\nZum Jahresanfang geben Volkswirte wie \xfcblich ihre Prognosen f\xfcr das Wirtschaftswachstum ab. F\xfcr 2014 prognostizieren die Experten ein Plus von 2,8 Prozent. Das sind jene Profis, die f\xfcr 2013 ein Wachstum von drei Prozent vorhergesagt hatten. Der aktuelle Konsens liegt aber bei nur mehr 1,6 Prozent. Die Wirtschaft ist in den vergangenen vier Jahren deshalb so langsam gewachsen \u2013 und das wird im besten Fall in den n\xe4chsten Jahren so bleiben - , weil die Verschuldung der Amerikaner so hoch ist, dass die Kreditsause bei den Konsumenten nicht mehr auf Hochtouren laufen kann. Sie machen aber fast 70 Prozent der Wirtschaftsleistung aus.\nDie steigenden Zinsen belasten die privaten Haushalte sehr, haben sie doch Schulden von 13 Billionen Dollar \u2013 das sind fast 80 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts. In den vergangenen Monaten sind die Hypothekenzinsen kr\xe4ftig gestiegen. Derzeit liegen die Hypothekenzinsen bei 4,5 Prozent. Vor einem Jahr lagen sie aber bei lediglich 3,4 Prozent. W\xe4hrend die Wirtschaft bis Mai 2013 R\xfcckenwind bekommen hatte, weil die Amerikaner ihre Hypotheken st\xe4ndig umfinanziert haben und das eingesparte Geld genutzt haben um zu konsumieren, ist das Spiel nun zu Ende. Die Antr\xe4ge f\xfcr Hypothekenkredite sind zuletzt auf ein 13-Jahres-Tief gefallen. Die Verk\xe4ufe bestehender H\xe4user sind in den vergangenen Monaten deutlich zur\xfcckgegangen. Und die Zinsen f\xfcr Konsumentenkredite und f\xfcr Studienkredite steigen ebenfalls. Die Studienkredite haben sich seit 2007 verdoppelt auf aktuell mehr als eine Billion Dollar.\nIn den n\xe4chsten Monaten droht der Konjunktur der n\xe4chste kr\xe4ftige D\xe4mpfer. Dann wird die neue Gesundheitsreform von Barack Obama eingef\xfchrt. Demnach m\xfcssen sich viele Amerikaner, die bislang keine Krankenversicherung haben, haupts\xe4chlich, weil diese Amerikaner es sich nicht leisten k\xf6nnen, eine Versicherung abschlie\xdfen. Laut Sch\xe4tzungen, m\xfcssen sich viele Amerikaner, die bisher eine Versicherung hatten, \xfcber einen Beitragsanstieg in der Gr\xf6\xdfenordnung von 30 bis 40 Prozent einstellen. Das Geld fehlt nachher beim Konsum.\nWie schwach der Konsum bereits ist, zeigen die Meldungen der Einzelh\xe4ndler wie Macy\xb4s, JCPenney und dem Elektronikh\xe4ndler Best Buy. Zuerst hat das Warenhaus Macy\xb4s 2500 Leute gefeuert und die Schlie\xdfung von f\xfcnf L\xe4den angek\xfcndigt. Danach hat der Konkurrent JCPenney angek\xfcndigt 33 Filialen zu schlie\xdfen. Gestern hat der Elektronikh\xe4ndler Best Buy miserable Zahlen gemeldet, woraufhin die Aktie um 30 Prozent abgeschmiert ist. So viel zu den Medienmeldungen \xfcber das angeblich florierende Gesch\xe4ft im US-Einzelhandel.\nBest Buy Best Buy\nEine baldige Besserung der Konjunktur ist nicht in Sicht. Zuletzt haben 1,3 Mio. Amerikaner ihre Anspr\xfcche auf Arbeitslosenhilfe verloren, weil die Republikaner das bei der Einigung im Haushaltsstreit durchgesetzt haben. Laut Sch\xe4tzungen werden bis Ende 2014 insgesamt f\xfcnf Mio. Amerikaner ihre Anspr\xfcche auf Arbeitslosenhilfe verlieren. Viele von ihnen haben aufgegeben nach einem Job zu suchen, weil sie keine Perspektive f\xfcr sich auf dem Arbeitsmarkt sehen. Weil sie aus der Statistik herausfallen, wird die Arbeitslosenquote in den n\xe4chsten Monaten deutlich sinken. Mit einer Verbesserung am Arbeitsmarkt hat das aber nat\xfcrlich nichts zu tun.\nBleibt die Frage, ob eine deutliche Konjunkturabk\xfchlung den Aktienmarkt bremsen kann. Zumal er im Langfristvergleich sehr teuer ist, was zuletzt sogar etliche Analysten betont haben. Das wird davon abh\xe4ngen, ob die designierte Fed-Chefin Janet Yellen im Notfall schnell umschwenken und das Anleihenkaufprogramm wieder hochfahren kann. Vor dem Hintergrund wird die Fed-Sitzung am 29. Januar spannend. Anleger sollten nicht nur den Aktienmarkt sondern auch den Anleihenmarkt im Auge behalten. Wenn die Zinsen f\xfcr zehnj\xe4hrige Anleihen wie schon seit Jahresanfang auf aktuell 2,85 Prozent weiter nachgeben, deutet das daraufhin, dass die Konjunktur die zuvor gestiegenen Zinsen nur schwer verkraftet. Dann k\xf6nnte dem Aktienmarkt kurzfristig Ungemach drohen \u2013 bis die Kavallerie kommt.'

message:	'President Obama;\n\n bad sleep last night. Woke up at 1a, thinking about this healthcare deal I voted for. I voted for it to give those that didn\'t have health insurance, health coverage so that they could have some form medical services to stay healthy. It seemed to me and hubby, and a few friends, that it was the \'human thing to do for our fellow humans that don\'t have any coverage\'. After listening to all the rhetoric that you can\'t lose your doctor, no matter what, it\'ll cover those that don\'t have and not at the cost of the taxpayer. Yada, yada, yada...1/2 truths, it would appear.\n\n We knew we\'d be on the medi*cal roll for a little bit, just long enough until I received my UIBs. So, reported that yesterday, thinking it\'d up us to qualify for insurance that I can pay for. Oh, so not.\n\n 1) missed the threshold for paying for coverage by a couple hundred dollars. Now get this, if you qualify for a discount on the lowest plan, you can only pay a couple of dollars a month. \n\n Even better now....because we didn\'t reach that extra couple of hundred dollars in our budget, the good ol\' government has decided that I cannot afford to pay for any insurance coverage at all, because I\'m lower than the threshold the Repubs had to have, to prove my income. I even asked them that if I held yard sales and sold crafts to make up the difference, would that help? guess what? "It can\'t be reported". (\'no\')\n\n Man, they figured out all options didn\'t they? My wonder is why they didn\'t allow for people to figure out on their own what they could afford and subsidize accordingly. \n\n Ya know what really gets that goat? That the government has decided that my husband and myself HAVE to HAVE this medi-cal. They have deemed that I do not have the sense to manage my money and make these tiny little monthly payments, (would just pay the year outright) but alas, they are making us take THEIR WELFARE!!\n\n 2) The doctor I\'ve had for the past 20 or so years, has sent us a "dear John" letter...Yes, my MD\'s office is no longer going to see us, but will for emergencies only for the next 30 days. Not EVEN giving us a call to discuss any other option for payment, like CASH! Really? dumping us because of lack of insurance & being forced onto medi-cal? I\'d have thought that at least lets DISCUSS something, nope, nada, we be gone! (it makes me sick to my stomach!) \n\n And fast forward to this morning...get up, hubby turns on news (positive way to start the day  ) and something about food stamps I think was on. \n\n Now if this isn\'t an oxymoron, I don\'t know what is...\n\n So, the republicans have gotten us to where people who don\'t want on welfare drolls now have to accept it, without choice, because it\'s the law that we have this health insurance and they know better than us how to manage our $$$, and in the same breath, they are cutting food stamps for the needy families with children. (thought might give them more $ to qualify to pay for their bene\'s; not!)\n\n Can you get what I\'m saying here? In one hand the gov\'ment is going to make sure we stay healthy by having health insurance, but they don\'t want you eating good and healthy food so they\'re cutting the SNAP program...Go figure!\n\nTo the republicans:   I\'m going to continue to pray that this government gets its head out of its proverbial behind, and do something for this country and it\'s commonwealth, that you signed on and got elected to do; you weren\'t elected to take care of only YOURSELVES...I cannot wait for 2016! GET THE BUMS OUT!\n\n Signed, \n 1 unhappy camper!'

Russia is nothing but shame to the world and Vladimir Putin just show his true ugly face, he should not be trusted at all. If we allow Russia to host 2014 olympic's then where only letting the terrorist freaks win. Ask your self that question one more time people do we really need that image? NO, not now, not tomorrow, not never. We need to fight back and show the terrorist's that we are not giving up, show Vladim Putin that he will never be in power, because his politic's will aways fail, and he is a person that is for discrimination. We are living in the 21 cenutry revoletion's, and to save our selfs, and the whole world we must take away the weapons from Russia and there nazi muslim allies. It's time to put our feet down and say no to Russia and there nazi muslim allies. Thank you, it's me the guy so called the anti christ, my real name is Nick."

If I can't afford insurance now, I won't be able to afford higher insurance with obamacare. Oh you say my premium is only???, but my deductible will be high to offset my low premium? Okay so I never meet my $10,000.00 deductible, because I don't have a job, and my insurance never kicks in, where do all my premium dollars go? Oh that's right nancy pelosi said there will be no lock box on revenues, so the monies collected in premiums, and taxes will go into the general fund. Is that the same general fund where Washington, DC spent the social security TRUST out of? If the American public doesn't already get it, Washington, DC has run out of other people's money, and need more to spend. obamacare is a ponzi scheme to end all ponzi schemes, but you leftist geniuses out there just keep on supporting this madness. That includes RINO's who are doing nothing. Remember inactivity is in and of itself an activity. When one third of the population loses their insurance they'll listen. What a bunch of lemmings."

Combine this with fast and furious, Bengazi, the IRS and NSA scandals among others you make Watergate look like a cookie stolen out of a cookie jar. To think I was just afraid of general incompetence which has continuously lead to job loss and an increase in the nanny state.\n\n Resign Mr. President and hopefully we can keep Ol' Uncle Joe gaff from doing anything too stupid."

message:	u'FYI\u2014In speaking with some of our patients at the HOYA Clinic here in D.C., I learned that no one intends to sign up for obamacare, and you can\u2019t blame them. These incredible survivors live well below the poverty level and many are homeless individuals and families. They do not have the financial resources for a computer or other means of communication, and many fear for their autonomy because of their legal status. Looks like his \u201cteam\u201d forgot about the discrepancy between theory and practice. Obama cares more about having some type of signature legislation than he does about the truly needy. He wouldn\u2019t walk a block in their shoes, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be playing golf again soon on some damn fantasy vacation on the taxpayers\u2019 dime.'

Please wait while we connect you to someone who can help. \n[10:07:55 am]:  Please be patient while we\'re helping other people. \n[10:08:06 am]: Welcome! You\'re now connected to Health Insurance Marketplace Live Chat.\n\nThanks for contacting us. My name is Lisa. To protect your privacy, please don\'t provide any personal information, like Social Security Number, or any other sensitive medical or personal information. \n[10:08:16 am]: Lisa \nGood Morning, How may I help you? \n[10:10:40 am]: Lisa \nAre you there? \n[10:12:57 am]: Lisa \nThank you for contacting Health Insurance Marketplace Live Chat. It appears that you are unable to see my reply; therefore, I am going to end the chat. If you can see this chat text and you still need assistance, please initiate a new chat. You may also call Health Insurance Marketplace Call Center at 1.800.318.2596. We are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist you. \n[10:15:02 am]: Miguel \nHi Lisa... Here is my experience with your site (I can now see you are not very patient... :( I was writing my concern and now I see you could not wait for me... I would have waited for you... Here it goes anyways: I have been helping employees "Navigate" on the health care web site. Most of the employees I\u2019ve helped are young and recent immigrants. They earn 10 to 12 dollars per hour, which is much more than the minimum; however, due to the high cost the company they work for does not offer them health insurance. In navigating the Health Care Site with some of the employees, I have found that they ask for Your Home Address, Your home and cell telephone numbers, Your employer\'s information, Your Salary, Your Social Security Number, who Your Mother is and a series of very personal health questions and when you are done the very last step is \u201cValidating Your Identity\u201d\u2026 It is then that the user finds out that such validation is done through a credit reporting agency\u2026 If you have no credit history they can\u2019t validate your identity and your requested to call an 800 number. At that 800 number they put you through the same process as the Web Site only that they ask the questions and take down your answers. At the end of the questions session, the same verification is in place and the user is then referred to yet another 800 number where the process begins all over again only this time the user is asked to send through regular US mail copies of two of the following documents: Passport, Driver License, Birth Certificate, Nationalization Document as Proof of Identity\u2026 It is then that the employees say \u201cThe hell with this\u201d \n[10:16:48 am]: Miguel \nMy concern is this: A lot, millions of recent and long time Immigrants and citizens Do NOt Hvae a Credit History; therefore they would be put through this same excruciating process and more likely than not they would rather pay the fine than complete the process \n[10:18:08 am]: Miguel \nHello...???? \n[10:18:36 am]: Lisa \nI am still reading your concern, please be patient. Thank you \n[10:21:12 am]: Lisa \nOkay, I do understand your concern with the healthcare.gov process. But in order for "anyone" to be qualified for health insurance, they all have to go through the same process. \n[10:22:18 am]: Lisa \nTo buy health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace, you must live in the United States, be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present, and cannot currently be incarcerated. Residents of a U.S. territory are not eligible to apply for health coverage through the Marketplace. U.S. territories can decide whether to create their own Marketplace or expand Medicaid coverage. \n[10:23:55 am]: Miguel \nIt will not work... Those who have no credit history are exactly the type of people who need the most help with an "Affordable Care"... given the hassle nd the fact that they do not have a CRedit History, I suspect, they will continue to do things they have been doing it: Going stright to the Emergency Room, thus increasing the cost for everyone involved... It makes absolutlly no sense at all \n[10:25:57 am]: Miguel \nI do not understand your information regarding qualification... I have that pretty clear \n[10:26:35 am]: Lisa \nI am sorry for frustration with this system, but, We can only give you information about Marketplace Health Insurance, Answer general Marketplace questions, Answer questions about health insurance basics, Give you information about how to enroll in the Marketplace. Even though we can provide you with information about the Marketplace. \n[10:27:40 am]: Lisa \nWe cannot give our opinions or advice about your health care options. We can provide you with the facts and help you understand your choices. If you need additional support, you can reach out to the consumer assistance programs within your state. I am more than happy to answer your questions that you have about the healthcare, if not, I will have to end this chat. \n[10:28:54 am]: Miguel \nIs there a way to contact someone who may need to know about these situations? I notice the Site does not offer such a way to contact someone who may have that capacity and pass along the concerns to the proper people \n[10:29:32 am]: Miguel \nYou are right: It is frustrating... very frustrating :( \n[10:29:39 am]: Lisa \nIf you need additional support, you can reach out to the consumer assistance programs within your state. \n[10:31:57 am]: Miguel \nYou see my concern goes deeper than the mere process... it goes to the heart of why we needed a health care reform. As it is: Those who need the help the most will be still left out of coverage therefore going back to what has brought the cost sky high: going to emergency rooms for health care and that is a very sad situation to be in :( \n[10:32:02 am]: Lisa \nYou may also call Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) at (888) 275-4772. Someone there could be able to help you further. \n[10:33:14 am]: Miguel \nThanks for your help, I will be calling the number to see how far we ma get with my initial concern... BTW the web site needs to be made much more user friendly \n[10:33:54 am]: Lisa \nNote taken. Thank you for contacting the Health Insurance Marketplace Live Chat. \n[10:34:00 am]: \'Lisa\' has left the chat session. \n[10:34:11 am]: Miguel \nThank you'

So now we are getting quotes for only insuring the kids and increasing our life insurance policies.  Great choices.  Self employed still get the shaft from your administration and the congress.  Want to really be fair?  Let us deduct our premiums from taxes  like everyone else does.  Stop making the middle class pay for the poor and start making corporations and the wealthiest 20% pony up.  Thanks for nothing.'

message:	'"Claim: Obamacare Website Security Now \'Much Worse Off\'"\n\nHealthcare.gov is far from "fixed" and users of it risk more than higher rates and higher deductibles from what they may have now. With identity theft being such a serious and growing problem in America, why didn\'t the #Obama administration and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius make security of the #ObamaCare website a top priority before launch? Why haven\'t they put the program on hold until it really gets fixed? Why is it getting worse instead of better?\n\n"But what\'s pretty evident right now is that the site itself is not secure. It\'s much worse off."\n\nVideo at the link: http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/claim-obamacare-website-security-now-much-worse_774864.html'

message:	"I myself have found some evidence here and there of Barracks genealogy on his father's side pointing to mostly Arabic descent with one relative confirmed african two generations back. In my searches I've found that Obama Sr. had 12.5% African in his blood, with the majority of percentile being Arabic. This would be make Barrack Obama Jr. (D-Nominee) 6.25% African blood, 43.75% Arabic, and 50% Caucasian. This would mean the self-proclamed potential 'first African-American' President would in actuality legally be an Arab-American, by standard of Federal Law. In our country it states in order to be legally considered of a certain ethnicity you must have at least 12.5% of that ethnicity's blood in you. \n\n This is disconcerting. Not becuase he may or may not be an Arab, but because he is LYING about it, if it is indeed true. There is nothing wrong with being from a place, or from a people, but to hide their link to you, or your heritage to it to gain the trust of people is indeed wrong. \n\n The question is: Is this true? Is this man who he claims to be? If so, there is no discussion. He means what he says, and is an honest individual who has this country's interests at heart. \n\n If not, than there are serious question that need to arise and come to light for him to answer. Would there be a hidden agenda, that forces him to hide his ancenstory and herritage?"

message:	"Written by Dr. Jack Wheeler\n\nThe O-man, Barack Hussein Obama, is an eloquently tailored empty suit. No resume, no accomplishments, no experience, no original ideas, no understanding of how the economy works, no understanding of how the world works, no balls, nothing but abstract, empty rhetoric devoid of real substance.\n\nHe has no real identity. He is half-white, which he rejects. The rest of him is mostly Arab, which he hides but is disclosed by his non-African Arabic surname and his Arabic first and middle names as a way to triply proclaim his Arabic parentage to people in Kenya . Only a small part of him is African Black from his Luo grandmother, which he pretends he is exclusively.\n\nWhat he isn't, not a genetic drop of, is 'African-American,' the descendant of enslaved Africans brought to America chained in slave ships. He hasn't a single ancestor who was a slave. Instead, his Arab ancestors were slave owners. Slave-trading was the main Arab business in East Africa for centuries until the British ended it.\n\nLet that sink in: Obama is not the descendant of slaves, he is the descendant of slave owners. Thus he makes the perfect Liberal Messiah.\n\nIt's something Hillary doesn't understand - how some complete neophyte came out of the blue and stole the Dem nomination from her. Obamamania is beyond politics and reason. It is a true religious cult, whose adherents reject Christianity yet still believe in Original Sin, transferring it from the evil of being human to the evil of being white.\n\nThus Obama has become the white liberals' Christ, offering absolution from the Sin of Being White. There is no reason or logic behind it, no faults or flaws of his can diminish it, no arguments Hillary could make of any kind can be effective against it. The absurdity of Hypocrisy Clothed In Human Flesh being their Savior is all the more cause for liberals to worship him: Credo quia absurdum, I believe it because it is absurd.\n\nThank heavens that the voting majority of Americans remain Christian and are in no desperate need of a phony savior."

message:	'A report in the "Washington Examiner" today says that 70 percent -- 70 percent of California doctors will opt out of Obamacare. The California Medical Association disputes that report but there is no question many American doctors are not going to get involved with the Affordable Healthcare Act.\n\nAs "Talking Points" has said from the beginning of this controversy, it will be the doctors who will make or break Obamacare. No doubt most working Americans will pay more for their health insurance but if the care was elevated that might be acceptable to some. However if doctors are not available the whole thing will collapse.\n\nAnd you know what? There\'s nothing President Obama can do about that. He can\'t force doctors into the Obamacare program. Until America\'s leaders -- leader is in a tight spot. He knows it, you know it. Right now his only solace may be up in the air.'

message:	u"Mr President:     if the latino people became the majority population in united states, there is no doubt 100% this country will become another Mexico.  Facing the truth and facing the reality. Most of latino women have 5 kids or 6 kids. Each of them need help for food, housing, medical care, child support, even need people help them to take care of their kids. It's ridiculous. kids are theirs, but other people have to pay it. They only pay little tax. THAT WILL NOT REDUCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET, THAT WILL INCREASE THE BUDGET, 100% I AM SURE. The United States will be bankruptcy as many south America countries.\nIronically many latino people even support this immigration reform . This is their stupidity.  They even have not realized that their women and kids need help, but The budget is limited, the  demand is unlimited. If their population become doubled and doubled, where is the money coming from? Only by the little tax they paid?  wake up! mr president,  what do you want to do for this country?  If this immigration reform had been passed, soon these latino people 's relatives will come to this country, more and more illegal immigrants will cross the border.  Believe me! As the first black president in united states, we know you want to help black people, but the american black will not support this immigration reform, LATINO PEOPLE  GRAB BENEFIT  FROM BLACK PEOPLE.  Even you support this reform, the latino community won\u2019t be appreciate of your kindness, they think you want their votes. \nOnce latino population become majority in the united states, soon latino will have their representative, senator, judge and president, then things become even worse on border, then out of control, soon this country become another Mexico. \nTo  president Obama :  . Do you remember just a couple months ago the cops found a tunnel underground from a city of Mexico to United States? There are over 2000 miles border between United states and Mexico.   You keep high pressure here,  you may reduce the amount of people to cross the border; if you pass this reform,  these people will be doubled within 20 years.  You won\u2019t be able to completely block the border, please don\u2019t insult public IQ!\nTo American black: two president candidates one white and one black, many white people voted Obama; for example, two candidates one latino and one black, I tell you 100% latino vote latino. Do you really seriously believe your life will be better if you stay in a latino country?  Wake up.\nTo latino people: you come here, because this country is the united states. If you turn the united states to become mexico, why do you come here? Wake up. I know some of you have small business, because you could hire many undocumented labor with the lowest pay; once these labor become documented, they will not accept such kind of low cash payment,  your these small business will close up immediately. Wake up!\nNow days the united states national debts are in astronomic amount,  but I tell you if the immigration reform was passed,  this country\u2019s financial situation will be 10 times worse than today. there is no doubt 100% this country will become another Mexico.  many south America countries are bankruptcy. Do you know a country which is called Argentina?  Many foreign banks have filed lawsuits against Argentina government, because they never pay back their debt! so Argentina president has to rent airplane to go aboard, otherwise if any Argentina government airplanes arrive to a foreign country,  the property of  this government will be detained by foreign courts.  Very very ridiculous!\nTo every people who see this message, if you don't want united states become another mexico, call your representative today, say NO to this immigration reform!\npost this message to your representative's facebook page!  Try your best to stop this immigration reform. Try your best to delay the wrong way of the United States to become another Mexico.\nIf Obamacare will cause united states financial difficulties,  the immigration reforms will make this country total bankruptcy.\nTo some business person:  don\u2019t dream of immigration reforms could bring you some cheap labor, the huge social expense for these people finally will charge from  your income tax and property tax,  for these latino women and their kids, though they are not your women and your kids, you still have to  pay for it.  \nDo you know why the Europe has so much financial problem nowadays?  Because of too many Arabian from middle eastern? These Arabian are exactly same as latino and even make more trouble than latino. North European countries have less Arabian, their situation is better, but they will be effected soon.   Germany primary administer has admitted their immigration policy is a failure. United states should get the lesson from it.  Because when you feel it, it\u2019s already too late. \nAs the first black president, I know you want to help black people, but latino also need help. this country only has limited amount of money, give it to latino, less money for black.  I really hope you could understand that."

THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING.....Also CHECK W/SNOPES(MEDICAL/KITHIL)\n\nPLEASE PASS THIS OUTRAGE TO EVERYONE ON YOUR LIST!!!  THIS should be read by everyone, especially important to those over 75....... If you are younger, then it may apply to your parents.... \n\nYour hospital Medicare admittance has just changed under the Affordable Care Act.  You must be admitted by your primary Physician in order for Medicare to pay for it!  If you are admitted by an emergency room doctor it is treated as outpatient care where hospital costs are not covered.  This is only the tip of the iceberg for Affordable Care Act.  Just wait to see what happens this year. (2014) \n\nYOU ARE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS... At age 76 when you need it most, you are not or may not be eligible for cancer treatment * see page 272 What Nancy Pelosi didn\'t want us to know until after the healthcare bill was passed.  Remember she said, "We have to pass the Bill so that we can see what\'s in it." Well, here it is. \n\nAffordable Care Act Highlighted by Page Number THE CARE BILL HB 3200 JUDGE KITHIL IS THE 2ND OFFICIAL WHO HAS OUTLINED THESE PARTS OF THE CARE BILL. \n\nJudge Kithil of Marble Falls, TX - highlighted the most egregious pages of HB3200. Please read this....... Especially the reference to pages 58 & 59 \n\nJUDGE KITHIL wrote: \n** Page 50/section 152: The bill will provide insurance to all non-U.S. Residents, even if they are here illegally. \n\n** Page 58 and 59: The government will have real-time access to an individual\'s bank account and will have the authority to make electronic fund transfers from those accounts. \n\n** Page 65/section 164: The plan will be subsidized by the government (taxpayers) for all union members, union retirees and for community organizations. \n\n** Page 203/line 14-15: The tax imposed under this section will not be treated as a tax. \n\n** Page 241 and 253: Doctors will all be paid the same regardless of specialty, and the government will set all doctors\' fees. This is what they do in Sweden too.\n\n** Page 272. Section 1145: Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient\'s age. \n\n** Page 317 and 321: The government will impose a prohibition on hospital expansion; however, communities may petition for an exception. \n** Page 425, line 4-12: The government mandates advance-care planning consultations. Those on Social Security will be required to attend an "end-of-life planning" seminar every five years. (Death counseling..) \n\n** Page 429, line 13-25: The government will specify which doctors can write an end-of-life order. \n\nHAD ENOUGH????  Judge Kithil then goes on to identify: \n\n"Finally, it is specifically stated that this bill will not apply to members of Congress. \n\nNo wonder they did not see the need to read it....doesn\'t apply to them!!! \n\nTHE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO STAND UP TO WASHINGTON .....NOW! THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! \n\nHonorable David Kithil of Marble Falls, Texas \n\nAll of the above should give you the ammo you need to oppose the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPlease send this information on to all of your email contacts.'

message:	u"The Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on the Benghazi attacks calls out the Obama administration for obstruction and says, \u201cThe role of the White House must be fully explored.\u201d\n\nThe report also issues a scathing indictment on the actions and decisions of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her management team.\n\nThe September 11, 2012, terrorist attacks took the lives of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Many more Americans were injured. \n\nAlthough the report only mentions then-Secretary Clinton by name once, the committee has determined that the attacks were preventable and cites the State Department for failure to act while having ample opportunity to heed the calls coming from Libya for increased security.  Members of the committee said this in a press release...\n\n\u201cThe Committee found the attacks were preventable, based on extensive intelligence reporting on the terrorist activity in Libya \u2014 to include prior threats and attacks against Western targets \u2014 and given the known security shortfalls at the U.S. Mission.\n\nThe State Department should have increased its security posture more significantly in Benghazi based on the deteriorating security situation on the ground\u2026\u201d\n\ndaniel, it is highly unlikely that you will find the following findings reported anywhere in the mainstream media\u2026   \n\nThe most damning details of the report emerged from minority members, Senators Chambliss, Burr, Risch, Coats, Rubio, and Coburn. Here are a few of their blistering bullet points:\n\nThe Obama administration is called out for obstruction of the investigation\u2026  \n\n    \u201cImportant questions remain unanswered as a direct result of the Obama Administration's failure to provide the Committee with access to necessary documents and witnesses\u2026 We believe the Administration's lack of cooperation is directly contrary to its statutory obligation to keep the congressional intelligence committees fully and currently informed and has effectively obstructed the Committee's efforts to get to the ground truth with respect to these remaining questions\u2026 We believe the role of the White House must be fully explored.\u201d \n\nThe administration\u2019s \u201ctaking points\u201d rebutted\u2026  \n\n    \u201cFrom the beginning, the Administration's handling of the Benghazi attacks has been a source of confusion to Congress, the American people, other nations, and-most significantly, the families of those killed in Benghazi\u2026 Instead, we were subjected to Sunday news programs, carefully crafted speeches, and delayed briefings - all designed to label the terrorist attacks as violent demonstrations spontaneously inspired by an obscure anti-Muslim film that has long since been forgotten.\u201d \n\nThen-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cited for failure\u2026 \n\n    \u201cUltimately, however, the final responsibility for security at diplomatic facilities lies with the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton\u2026 At the end of the day, she was responsible for ensuring the safety of all Americans serving in our diplomatic facilities. Her failure to do so clearly made a difference in the lives of the four murdered Americans and their families.\u201d \n\nAs Hillary Clinton begins her widely anticipated run for the presidency in 2016, every American should be asking what kind of leadership she would bring to the nation when it was her failed leadership of the State Department which is cited as being the major source of fault in the failure to protect American outposts and lives.\n\n++Important questions remain unanswered.\n\nEvery citizen should also be concerned with the Committee\u2019s findings that \u201cImportant questions remain unanswered as a direct result of the Obama Administration's failure to provide the Committee with access to necessary documents and witnesses.\u201d\n\nThe ability to subpoena President Obama, witnesses, and necessary documents to uncover critical details is vital to this ongoing investigation. \n\n++ It is high time for the stonewalling to end and for Members of Congress to establish a Select Committee to uncover the truth!\n\nI see no other way of getting answers without establishing a Select Committee. We must hold those responsible accountable!\n\ndaniel, this is where you come in.  Join America\u2019s Special Ops veterans and over 109,000 of your fellow Liberty Counsel Action supporters in calling on Congress to do its job and FULLY investigate the Benghazi cover-up!\n\nLiberty Counsel Action is hand delivering our second petition demanding a full investigation into the Benghazi attacks and cover-up to the offices of Senators Graham, Reid, and McConnell \u2013 as well as to Representatives Wolfe, Boehner, and Cantor next week!\n\ndaniel, I want your voice to be included in this very important petition delivery."

I was even specially invited to a party celebrating the American Independence Day, where many U.S. diplomats and the ambassador appreciated my meritorious deeds.\nEven though it happened a long time ago I've been living with a pride that once I protected the lives and the property of the U.S. and thought I may end up getting a medal of honor. \nTwenty years passed after I came to the U.S.\nAnd now I am under a great shocked.\nThe U.S. is being destroyed by an awful criminal group, but nobody is realizing this critical situation. \nTo jump to the conclusion, this case happened because there is no effective gun control act in the U.S. \nThe case I would like to present is much more terrible than any other bizarre ones that have surprised the world.\nIf this negligence continues on, inevitably, the US will collapse in the near future.\nAs I have loved the U.S and I defended the U.S. embassy in Korea, I'm now trying to save the U.S., with my life on line. \nI intend to reveal the truth behind this horrible case, in order to point the necessity of a proper gun control law in the U.S. \nThen, all the people in the country would have no choice but to support the gun control law, including those that deal firearms. \nIt\u2019s the only way to the rescue the USA"

message:	u"Please help me spread or share this message by posting it on your page and sending it to your friends, news media and political organizations. Thanks in advance for your prayers,  help and support!  My name is Carlos Salomon. As a Black man among many innocent victims, \xcd was beaten up, tortured and terrorized in Jacksonville,  Florida by a police officer inside my premise without any justification. As a result, I am suffering since with total and permanent physical and psychological injuries. So deceitful is the American justice, I've been fed with a daily bread of injustices facing the disease of racism and the toxication of corruptions from the government, my ex attorney Ronald S Guralnick and Ronald S Guralnick P.A in coalition with the mobs. Yet, they kept 11 million dollars settlement offer that I agreed upon to be collected for my permanent injuries. Still I haven't received a dime. Honorable Mr. President Barack Obama, please help me regarding. Furthermore, on the other hand, the State of Florida Child Support Department robbed almost 5,000.00 dollars from my TIB bank trust fund account. It was a robbery because the State of Florida withdrew approximately 5,000.00 dollars from my TIB bank trust fund account without my knowledge, a warrant or a court order. The US former presidential candidate, Mr. Mitt Romey retains the ownershp of the TIB bank as a buyer. The State of Florida Child Support Department claimed that my trust fund was seized for back child support payment. However, the evidence presented on my behalf before the Duval County Court in Jacksonville, Florida shows not only i never owed any back child support payment but i also paid more than what \xed was required to pay under the law. Still the State of Florida government has not returned my money with interest and expenses that they robbed or illegally seized from my trust fund account. \nHonorable Mr. President Barack Obama, as you can see, the fight for equal justice and civil right is not over because the United States of America is a nation where the government still practices even today injustices, racism and corruptions. Once again, please help me! For all correspondence please write: Carlos  Salomon P.O. Box 900474 Homestead, FL 33090  Phone number (305) 4965778"

message:	"This insurance diabolical is about to run me crazy. I'm at my wits end, literally. London still doesn't have insurance. Last week I recieved an automated message that said I needed to call HC.gov, because one or more of my family members didn't qualify for state run healthcare (note, I wanted to put London on our policy, but they won't let us!) \n\nSo I call HC.gov, it's an hour long dead end, with them telling me to call ALL Kids, which I did while I was on the phone with HC.gov. I waited for thirty minutes with one phone to one ear, one phone to the other to be hung up on by HC.gov and ALL Kids saying to call back, that London's applications hadn't even been processed yet!!!! \n\nBoth companies said they didn't call me. So who did? No one knows. \n\nI have been in tears over this, literally at a loss, because I cannot do anything and no one can help me. I finally called our state Senators office and of course I'm given another number to call. I got a recording that told me to leave a message and someone would call back between 2 and 4 days! \n\nIt's dead end, after dead end, after dead end and no one cares! Wasn't the entire Affordable Care Act junk suppose to be so EVERYONE would be insured and those who weren't would pay a penalty? Now London is forced to NOT be insured, because of the ACA!!!! \n\nI can't take this anymore. I want to scream. I have been receiving some call from a Health Care Reform number, they leave a recording which tells me to call back. I called back to see how they got my number, because the recording had to do with prescription drug help and an Indian answered. I told her if they didn't remove my phone number from their database today, after calling twice a day for a week I was going to the police the next call I got. \n\nHow did they get my phone number? I have a cellphone only. I'm sick of this. I am tired up to the brim. To those of you who voted for Obama and those state representatives who get the electoral votes to put him in office, thanks so much for your help. You have really caused a lot of suffering for my family. \n\nI've already had to take London to the doctor since our old policy was canceled, which one of you Obama supporters want's to pay my medical bills? Who wants to refund me my $120 for medication? Who wants to give me my $400 back for an office visit on a Sunday!!!!!!!!!"

message:	"Jesus said, what's for Cesar give it to Cesar and what's for God, give it  to God. I am for God, how about you? I am Not  for a God of killing, as others believe, but a God of love, peace, joy happiness, a God that doesn't condone sin. This world is at its peek, as I look around, all I see is; violence, disasters, wars, people increasing in knowledge. I tell you this, this whole world have never seen such disasters tell now. ln the past we have  had disasters and violence here and there but  we have never seen it  accumulate in one time period such as this. for  Example: while American was going through slavery and  even civil war, Jamaica wasn't going through it, belize wasn't going through it, and many more, yes, these countries have had their problems but in different time periods .however now we have reached a time where the whole earth is at war; man agents man  nature agents nature and  it's happening in one to two years apart. If you don't see this, you're blind or  a sleep.  You have seen all these typhoons, tsunami, earthquakes, tornados,hurricanes, floods, diseases  war, killing of children, parents killing children, children killing parents,  this is happening all over the world in one period, well, this had happened in one year, and  is still multiplying.  Can't you see This is not just a physical war, it's a spiritual war aswell. I mean, we aren't the only ones at war, but nature aswell. people rather to do Satan will than follow jesus, he told us of this, Yeth we seem to ignore him. This is why he died, to save us from all this. Yeth the bible says, this is only the beginning . Believe it  are not, this world will come to an end."

message:	u"Mr President:     if the latino people became the majority population in united states, there is no doubt 100% this country will become another Mexico.  Facing the truth and facing the reality. Most of latino women have 5 kids or 6 kids. Each of them need help for food, housing, medical care, child support, even need people help them to take care of their kids. It's ridiculous. kids are theirs, but other people have to pay it. They only pay little tax. THAT WILL NOT REDUCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET, THAT WILL INCREASE THE BUDGET, 100% I AM SURE. The United States will be bankruptcy as many south America countries.\nIronically many latino people even support this immigration reform . This is their stupidity.  They even have not realized that their women and kids need help, but The budget is limited, the  demand is unlimited. If their population become doubled and doubled, where is the money coming from? Only by the little tax they paid?  wake up! mr president,  what do you want to do for this country?  If this immigration reform had been passed, soon these latino people 's relatives will come to this country, more and more illegal immigrants will cross the border.  Believe me! As the first black president in united states, we know you want to help black people, but the american black will not support this immigration reform, LATINO PEOPLE  GRAB BENEFIT  FROM BLACK PEOPLE.  Even you support this reform, the latino community won\u2019t be appreciate of your kindness, they think you want their votes. \nOnce latino population become majority in the united states, soon latino will have their representative, senator, judge and president, then things become even worse on border, then out of control, soon this country become another Mexico. \nTo  president Obama :  . Do you remember just a couple months ago the cops found a tunnel underground from a city of Mexico to United States? There are over 2000 miles border between United states and Mexico.   You keep high pressure here,  you may reduce the amount of people to cross the border; if you pass this reform,  these people will be doubled within 20 years.  You won\u2019t be able to completely block the border, please don\u2019t insult public IQ!\nTo American black: two president candidates one white and one black, many white people voted Obama; for example, two candidates one latino and one black, I tell you 100% latino vote latino. Do you really seriously believe your life will be better if you stay in a latino country?  Wake up.\nTo latino people: you come here, because this country is the united states. If you turn the united states to become mexico, why do you come here? Wake up. I know some of you have small business, because you could hire many undocumented labor with the lowest pay; once these labor become documented, they will not accept such kind of low cash payment,  your these small business will close up immediately. Wake up!\nNow days the united states national debts are in astronomic amount,  but I tell you if the immigration reform was passed,  this country\u2019s financial situation will be 10 times worse than today. there is no doubt 100% this country will become another Mexico.  many south America countries are bankruptcy. Do you know a country which is called Argentina?  Many foreign banks have filed lawsuits against Argentina government, because they never pay back their debt! so Argentina president has to rent airplane to go aboard, otherwise if any Argentina government airplanes arrive to a foreign country,  the property of  this government will be detained by foreign courts.  Very very ridiculous!\nTo every people who see this message, if you don't want united states become another mexico, call your representative today, say NO to this immigration reform!\npost this message to your representative's facebook page!  Try your best to stop this immigration reform. Try your best to delay the wrong way of the United States to become another Mexico.\nIf Obamacare will cause united states financial difficulties,  the immigration reforms will make this country total bankruptcy.\nTo some business person:  don\u2019t dream of immigration reforms could bring you some cheap labor, the huge social expense for these people finally will charge from  your income tax and property tax,  for these latino women and their kids, though they are not your women and your kids, you still have to  pay for it.  \nDo you know why the Europe has so much financial problem nowadays?  Because of too many Arabian from middle eastern. These Arabian are exactly same as latino and even make more trouble than latino. North European countries have less Arabian, their situation is better, but they will be effected soon.   Germany primary administer has admitted their immigration policy is a failure. United states should get the lesson from it.  Because when you feel it, it\u2019s already too late. \nMr president, why do you let so many muslim Arabian come to the united states?  There is a country called Sudan( now it has been divided as north Sudan where most of population are Arabian and south Sudan where most of population are black. just a couple of years ago, it\u2019s called Sudan). In Sudan, 35% of Arabian muslim and 65% of black people, Arabian muslim killed millions of black people in that country, it\u2019s called slaughter.  These Arabian muslim let black people dig out a big pit for themselves, then shot them all, threw their bodies into the pit and buried the bodies. Then let another group of black people dig out a pit for themselves, then shot them all, threw their bodies into the pit and buried the bodies. They have killed millions of black people by this way in Sudan. Mr president:  Do you still like these muslim Arabian? \nAs the first black president, I know you want to help black people, but latino also need help. this country only has limited amount of money, give it to latino, less money for black.  I really hope you could understand that."

message:	"DEAR FRIENDS FROM ARMENIA AND ALL OVER THE WORLD PLEASE SHARE THIS APPEAL OF ARMENIANS FROM KESSAB\n\nAn appeal to all Armenians across the world from the Armenians in Kessab.\n\nOn Mother's Day, March 21-2014, our beautiful town was brutally attacked by Al-Qaeda extremists And Al Nusra front that is linked to Al Qaeda. with the blessings and full military and logistical support of the Turkish government.\n\nBefore sunrise, we woke up to the horror of a shower of missiles and rockets falling on our town. Thousands of extremists crossed the borders towards our town. Missiles were fired from Turkey, to destroy beautiful Kessab and to celebrate the approach of the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Kesabtsi heroes defended the town with their simple hunting weapons until more forces from the Syrian government came to fight back the horrific attack on our town. If Kessabtsis were not informed to leave their houses by those heroes, the world would have silently witnessed yet another genocide and stood by while the media gave them yet another version of lies.\n\nKessab has always been home to thousands of Armenians for centuries. The first agonizing tragedy in Kesab happened in April 1909, when a rabble of thousands of Turkish men attacked Kessab, robbing and burning houses. 161 Armenians were killed in this brutal attack. In 1915, during the Armenian genocide, Turkish troops came into Kessab and started deporting Armenians and killed almost 5000 Armenian people from Kessab. The Armenian genocide at the hands of the Turks in 1915 took the lives of One and a half million Armenians. More Armenians are getting killed and will get killed in Syria if nothing is done. The Arabs in Syria took us in then, took care of us, helped us back on our feet and helped us survive through that horrible memory of death and destruction and we will be eternally grateful to them. Since then we lived in peace and harmony with other sects, like a huge family in a home called Syria.\n\nToday, we need help once again, because Sadly the Turkish government dared to attack Armenians one more time ignoring the Armenian case. With this act Turkey has refused, yet again, to recognize the Armenian genocide at the hands of the Turks and is assisting in the murder of more Armenians in Syria. We have nothing against the Turkish people. We have lived as neighbors with them and want to continue to live as neighbors with them. It is the Turkish government, supporting and facilitating the murder of Kessabtsis by terrorists, that we plea against. We just want our town back, or what's remained of it. Because there are a lot of videos on youtube that shows how those extremists are destroying and burning our beautiful town. All Syria knows wherever those extremists get in, only death and destruction is left behind.\n\nOur homes have been taken from us, centuries of our heritage has been destroyed.\n\nThis is a call to all Armenians. This is a call to humanity. The world needs to hear the truth. Erdogan and his government are war criminals. We need your help. We need you to take action. Our lives hang in the chance that you will do something to make sure we too don't die. We were forced out of our homes and our town with nothing but the clothes we wear. If we stayed to gather even the bare necessities, we would have definitely died. Most of us cannot even escape because we don't have our passports or documents of identification. Please, invoke the intervention of your governments, of the UN, of any other authority that you believe can help us. All we want to do, is live. If you ignore this, we all will die a horrible death at the hands of these terrorists, by being butchered in cold blood like many other Armenians in Aleppo, Yacoubiyeh, Ghenemiyeh, and around Syria.\n\nThose who you call rebels are extremists who came to Syria for jihad with many nationalities in it like Afghans, Chechen, Saudis etc. Kessabtsis and all of Syria, saw them and were attacked and killed by them. The media can't hide the truth forever. You can't manipulate the lives of people forever. Those who you call rebels, were targeting and attacking civilians. Wake up, please.\n\nDon't you think enough innocent blood has been split? Don't you think enough destruction has been done? We all lived peacefully and happily just three years ago. This is not a revolution, this is war. And the Syrian army is now in Kessab fighting to make sure Armenians will go back to their homes safely.\n\nPS: This letter has been written by Kessabtsis being given refuge by the Armenian Church in Lattakia."
